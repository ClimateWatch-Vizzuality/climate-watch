    climateRisks: `A risk is often represented as probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the impacts if these events or trends occur.In this case, the impacts are the effects on natural and human systems of extreme weather and climate events and of climate change.Impacts generally refer to effects on lives, livelihoods, health, ecosystems, economies, societies, cultures, services, and infrastructure due to the interaction of climate changes or hazardous climate events occurring within a speciﬁc time period and the vulnerability of an exposed society or system.
