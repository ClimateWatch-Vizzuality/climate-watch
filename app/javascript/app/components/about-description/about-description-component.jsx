    Climate Watch is an online platform designed to empower policymakers,
    researchers, media and other stakeholders with the open climate data,
    visualizations and resources they need to gather insights on national and
    global progress on climate change. Climate Watch brings together dozens of
    datasets for the first time to let users analyze and compare the Nationally
    Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, access historical
    emissions data, discover how countries can leverage their climate goals to
    achieve their sustainable development objectives, and use models to map new
    pathways to a lower carbon, prosperous future. This free platform enables
    users to create and share custom data visualizations and comparisons of
    national climate commitments. It contributes to the goals of the Paris
    Agreement by using open data to increase transparency and accountability,
    and provide actionable analysis on how countries can enhance their efforts
    to combat climate change. Climate Watch includes: Data and visualizations on
    all countries’ greenhouse gas emissions; A comprehensive, user-friendly
    database of all countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs);
    Comprehensive mapping of linkages between Nationally Determined
    Contributions (NDCs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and
    associated targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Data and
    visuals of emissions scenario pathways for major emitting countries, derived
    from a growing library of models; National and sectoral profile pages that
    offer a snapshot of climate progress, risks and vulnerabilities; and The
    ability to download data and create, save and share customized data
    visualizations through My Climate Watch. Climate Watch is implemented by
    World Resources Institute in collaboration with partners.
