      'Countries that are Parties to the Paris Agreement are required to outline their post-2020 climate actions, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). NDCs embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Countries are also invited to communicate “mid-century long-term low GHG emissions development strategies” (long-term strategies, or LTS). NDCs and LTS are central to achieving the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C.',
