CAIT uses the 2016 edition of the IEA publication for CO₂ emissions from fossil fuel combustion from 1971 to 2014, and draws the remaining CO₂ and non-CO₂ emissions data from a variety of other sources including CDIAC, U.S. EPA, and FAO. (See <a href="http://cait2.wri.org/docs/CAIT2.0_CountryGHG_Methods.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" >CAIT GHG Sources and Methods Documentation</a> for more detailed information.)</li><li><a href="http://pmd.gfz-potsdam.de/pik/showshort.php?id=escidoc:2086888" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" >Primap’s dataset</a> combines several published datasets to create a comprehensive set of GHG emission pathways for every country and Kyoto gas covering the years 1850 to 2014 for all 197 UNFCCC parties as well as most non-UNFCCC territories. The data resolves the main IPCC 1996 categories. For CO₂ from energy and industry, time series for subsectors are available. Country level data is combined from different sources using the PRIMAP emissions module. It is supplemented with growth rates from regionally resolved sources and numerical extrapolations.

        title: 'What are the main differences between the three data sources?',
        answer:
          'UNFCCC provides official country-reported inventories; CAIT and PIK are estimates made by non-government research institutes. CAIT and PIK datasets apply a consistent methodology and are comparable across all countries included. The UNFCCC dataset is not comparable across all countries, due to the different reporting requirements and methodologies for Annex 1 and non-Annex 1 countries. Non-Annex 1 countries also don’t report a complete time series of data for each year. The PIK dataset prioritizes country-reported inventories and fills the data gaps with secondary sources and assumptions. CAIT uses none of the self-reported inventories for individual countries and instead uses datasets with global coverage. Thus, the PIK dataset aligns better with country-reported estimates, while CAIT provides an independent inventory that compliments the other two. Among other methodology differences, CAIT uses global warming potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (AR2) for non-CO2 gases; PIK provides data under both AR2 and AR4 GWP values; UNFCCC data uses either AR2 and AR4, depending on the inventory methodology the party opts to follow. '

        answer:
          'According to the Working Group III Contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel combustion are known within 8% uncertainty (90% confidence interval). CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from FOLU (forestry and other land use) have very large uncertainties attached in the order of ± 50%. Uncertainty for global emissions of CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and the F-gases has been estimated as 20%, 60% and 20% respectively. For the PIK dataset, regional deforestation emissions are downscaled to country level using estimates of the deforested area obtained from potential vegetation and calculations for the needed agricultural land. So, levels of uncertainty are quite high for earlier years of data (closer to 1850).  '

Linkages are determined through textual analysis of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to identify alignments of targets, actions, policy measures and needs. Analysis was only conducted at the target level, meaning the texts of submitted NDCs were compared against the text of the 169 SDG targets. The language in the 17 SDGs is broader than in the targets, so analysis was not conducted at that level. What appears as goal level analysis (on the landing page of the NDC-SDG module) is an aggregation of the analysis at the target level. It is important to note that this analysis only looks at countries’ NDCs and so does not necessarily reflect a country’s actions in the real world. Lastly, the analysis is inherently subjective, so other analysis may result in different conclusions. If this is the case, please let us know at <a href="mailto:climatewatch@wri.org">climatewatch@wri.org</a>.

          "<p>Models in this context are computer programs used to investigate climate change mitigation and adaptation options as well as other potential targets, like economic targets or energy targets. They can be run using different input assumptions, for example a certain mix of energy sources. The inputs and outputs used in a model are collectively referred to as a “scenario,” so there may be multiple scenarios under one model.</p><p>Please note that using scenarios is different from forecasting or making projections. A forecast or projection tries to predict the future state of a system, like what the economy or a country's energy mix will be in ten years; a scenario within one of these models is a set of outputs assuming one of many different combinations of a country’s energy mix. </p>"

        answer:
          'The answer to this question varies by scenario. Almost all Business as Usual or Reference case scenarios show that we are not on track to keep global warming under 2°C. However, more ambitious scenarios show that it is possible to keep the global warming under 2°C by using technologies like carbon capture and storage with bioenergy and increased renewable energy.'
