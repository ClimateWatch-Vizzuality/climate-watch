However, it is currently used in an inefficient manner with high levels of indoor pollution. A number of programmes have been initiated for promotion of cleaner and more efficient use, including biomass-based electricity generation. It is envisaged to increase biomass installed capacity to 10 GW by 2022 from current capacity of 4.4 GW.&rdquo; India also lists the mitigation technologies that the country plans to implement which include &ldquo;accelerated-driven systems in advanced nuclear fuel cycles&rdquo; and &ldquo;renewable energy.&rdquo;</p>"

The UAE has therefore made the strategic decision to diversify its energy mix, increase efficiency, and continue to use world-class performance standards and the best available technologies in its energy intensive industries and its oil and gas sectors.\"</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Clean Energy Target </span></p> <p>\"The UAE set the region&rsquo;s first renewable energy targets, at a time when there was widespread doubt about renewable energy&rsquo;s viability and value. Since then, the country&rsquo;s deployment of renewable energy has had a significant normalizing effect for the technology in the region. This is now joined by a compelling financial case, with recent results in the UAE recording the lowest cost for solar globally.</p> <p>The UAE has set a target of increasing clean energy contribution to the total energy mix from 0.2% in 2014, to 24% by 2021. This will be achieved through renewable and nuclear energy, and is underpinned by detailed emirate level targets and policies.\"</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Improvements in Energy Intensive Industries and the Oil and Gas Sector </span></p> <p>\"The UAE&rsquo;s energy intensive industries and oil and gas sectors will continue to use innovative technologies to improve efficiency and reduce emissions.</p> <p>The UAE&rsquo;s oil companies are among the most efficient globally. The UAE&rsquo;s national oil company was the first in the region to promote the reduction of gas flaring, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In energy intensive industries, overall performance indicators will be improved through carbon abatement measures and increased resource efficiency.</p> <p>The UAE is also developing the region&rsquo;s first commercial-scale network for carbon capture, usage and storage. The project notably captures and compresses emissions at a steel manufacturing facility, which will be compressed and transported to oil fields, where it will be used to enhance oil recovery and ultimately be stored underground providing one of the first viable mechanisms to decarbonize essential energy intensive industries.\"</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Energy and Water Efficiency </span></p> <p>\"In addition to supply side targets, the UAE is undertaking comprehensive policies to reduce energy and water demand and promote the prudent use of resources, through the following actions:</p> <ul> <li>Tariff reform: The UAE recognizes the value of energy and water tariff reform in reducing inefficiencies and promoting low-carbon development, as well as addressing energy security concerns. To this end, utility authorities in&nbsp;the UAE have introduced a number of initiatives and policies, and revised the country&rsquo;s tariffs over the years and gradually adjust the tariffs for commercial and industrial customers, so as to reflect the cost of generation by 2021.</li> <li>Building and efficiency standards: the UAE is comprehensively targeting emissions from its building sector, which account for a significant percentage of the country&rsquo;s electricity and water consumption, through green building regulations, efficiency standards, retrofit programs and support structures for energy service companies across the UAE.</li> <li>Demand side management: the UAE has launched a number of initiatives based on consumer awareness and demand management, including new formats for water and electricity bills, which give residents detailed consumption and subsidy information.</li> <li>District cooling: air-conditioning accounts for a significant share of energy consumption, given the UAE&rsquo;s harsh climate. Comprehensive infrastructure investments are being undertaken to move towards district cooling and improve efficiency as compared to decentralized cooling.</li> <li>Appliance efficiency standards: the UAE introduced the region&rsquo;s first efficiency standards for air-conditioning units, eliminating the lowestperforming 20% of units on the market, and is introducing efficiency standards for refrigeration and other appliances. The UAE has also established an indoor lighting standard that introduces energy efficient lighting products and phases-out inefficient lighting products in the UAE market.\"</li> </ul> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Transport and Infrastructure </span></p> <p>\"Infrastructure development is critical to the UAE&rsquo;s plans for economic diversification and the country has made infrastructure development a key priority area. The government is investing heavily in world-class traffic and transport systems. For example, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi has adopted a comprehensive urban structure framework plan, to optimize the city&rsquo;s development up to 2030.</p> <p>The UAE is undertaking the following investments and initiatives, which will have significant mitigation co-benefits in addressing the transport sector&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions, including:</p> <ul> <li>the introduction of a new fuel pricing policy, which will put the UAE in line with global prices. This reform aims to support the national economy, lower fuel consumption, and protect the environment;</li> <li>a federal freight rail network crossing the country and eventually integrated into the GCC network;</li> <li>the Emirate of Abu Dhabi has also set targets to shift 25% of government vehicle fleets to compressed natural gas; and</li> <li>the Emirate of Dubai has invested in a multi-billion dollar light-rail and metro system, which will continue to add new lines.</li> </ul> <p>The UAE continues to improve the emission standards for new motor vehicles, in accordance with European emission standards, as well as through the introduction of standard labels. These initiatives target both improvements in fuel economy and reduction in local air pollution.</p> <p>The UAE will also introduce comprehensive regulations for electric vehicles, so as to facilitate their uptake domestically.\"</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Waste Sector </span></p> <p>\"The UAE will increase the amount of treated waste, and waste diverted from landfill, through a number of key initiatives, including:</p> <ul> <li>developing a federal law to regulate and oversee waste management;</li> <li>defining a federal roadmap for integrated waste; and,</li> <li>developing a federal database to gather and collect information regarding waste.\"</li> </ul>"

Energy Contribution</p> <p>\"Brunei Darussalam has an aspirational target to reduce total energy consumption by 63% by 2035 from a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario. This will be achieved by implementing policies and actions in a number of areas which are outlined in the following sections, and by further research, development and capacity building in areas where the magnitude of possible climate change mitigation benefits have yet to be determined.</p> <p>1.1 Reduction of Energy Intensity Across all Economic Sectors</p> <p>A reduction of 45% in energy intensity is measured as a 45% reduction in tonnes of oil equivalent per unit of gross domestic product, using 2005 as a base year. This will be achieved by implementing a number of measures including:</p> <p>Policies and regulatory frameworks for energy efficiency and conservation:<br />i. Electricity Tariff Reform<br />ii. Energy Efficiency and Conservation Building Guidelines for Non-Residential Sector<br />iii. Standards and Energy Labelling for Products and Appliances<br />iv. Energy Management Policy<br />v. Fuel Economy Regulation<br />vi. Financial Incentives<br />vii. Awareness Raising</p> <p>Project based energy efficiency measures such as the increased use of energy efficient streetlights. This involves replacement of the existing high pressure sodium vapour street lighting to low wattage and superior technology lighting to increase standards nationwide.</p> <p>1.2&nbsp;Increasing the share of Renewable Energy in the national total power generation mix</p> <p>Increasing the share of renewables so that 10% of the total power generation is sourced from renewable energy by 2035 which will be achieved through measures such as:</p> <p>i. Increasing the use of solar power as a renewable resource. To this end a three year study from 2010-2012 was carried out on six types of solar cells at the Tenaga Suria Solar Power Plant (a solar demonstration project) to increase technical capacity for deploying solar resources in future</p> <p>ii. Utilising the 10-15 MW potential of waste to energy resources that have already been identified in the Energy White Paper.</p> <p>1.3 Land Transport</p> <p>In 2014, Brunei Darussalam published its Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP); based on a comprehensive assessment of the country&rsquo;s current land transport situation. A variety of forecasts and mitigation scenarios were explored; however the preferred scenario, and that most in line with the Wawasan Brunei 2035 national vision, entails a 40% reduction in morning peak hour carbon dioxide emissions against a BAU scenario in 2035. With no action, the BAU scenario represents a 178% net increase in GHG emissions over 2012 levels. However in implementing the preferred scenario, this will limit the net increase in emissions in 2035 to 67% over 2012 levels.</p> <p>In order to achieve this scenario, as well as various other transport policy objectives, the Land Transport White Paper sets out a total of 38 transport policy recommendations, some of which are immediately relevant to GHG mitigation, such as implementing fuel standards or promoting electric and hybrid vehicles.\"</p> <p>For more information on the implementation plans to achieve energy intensity reduction goals; renewable energy goal, and land transport policy planes, please refer to Section 5 \"Planning for Implementation\" of the INDC.&nbsp;</p> <p>2 Mitigation Contributions from the Forestry and Land Use Sectors</p> <p>\"Brunei Darussalam is considered one of the world&rsquo;s leading nations in terms of its actions to preserve forest cover, with currently approximately 75% of its 5,765 square kilometres national land area is under forest cover. It is comprised of what experts believe to be the oldest tropical rainforest ecosystem in the world, but also mangroves, peat swamps and other areas which sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p> <p>Approximately 41% of the country&rsquo;s land area have been gazetted as forest reserves. These forest reserves are protected by robust legislation. The Government of Brunei Darussalam intends to increase the total gazette forest reserves to 55%, and has already commenced working with the relevant authorities to increase the area. The decision to ban logging concessions from nationally designated forest reserves has also been implemented. Restricted and controlled logging will only be allowed in designated Inter Riverine Zones (IRZ), a small area of land which has been strictly regulated by volume quotas to manage activity in the region. IRZ areas in the country are small areas, totalling 50,000 hectares, of which logging and forest plantation can only take place in a designated area of 30,000 hectares.</p> <p>Brunei Darussalam is also a key member of the &ldquo;Heart of Borneo&rdquo; Initiative, a trilateral forest conservation agreement signed with Malaysia and Indonesia to preserve and protect its remaining unique ecosystems. The initiative will further ensure the best sustainable forestry practices in the country.\"</p> <p>3 Other mitigation measures</p> <p>\"The Government of Brunei Darussalam has developed building guidelines; all buildings including commercial and housing estates, industrial and government buildings are required to set aside or to retain 10% of the land as open space or green area.</p> <p>Studies are being undertaken to identify measures to reduce flaring and venting during gas extraction, which in turn will reduce emissions of methane and carbon dioxide. Gas flaring and venting also wastes valuable energy resources that could be used to support economic growth.\"</p>"

This policy is implemented using four pillars, namely: set different prices for petroleum products based on energy generation efficiency; increase the efficiency of energy use; provide support to certain sectors to promote switching from conventional energy sources to clean energy sources; and apply the fuel subsidy smartcard system to ensure that subsidies are received by target beneficiaries.</li> </ol> <p>The degree to which efficiency improvements can limit energy demand growth is one of the main distinguishing characteristics of greenhouse gas reduction pathways. Energy efficiency could be improved radically through a combination of behavioral changes and rapid introduction of stringent efficiency regulations, technology standards, and environmental externality pricing, which mitigates rebound effects.</p> <p>Renewable energy technologies, which are relevant to the local context, will play a very important role in reducing GHG emissions, but they would not suffice to keep climate change manageable. However, renewable energy may provide a number of opportunities since it also addresses sustainable and equitable economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, and reduced local environmental and health impacts.</p> <p>In addition, efforts in Egypt should focus on replacing or upgrading obsolete infrastructure e.g. upgrading old fossil fuel power plants with locally appropriate technologies to increase its capacity. This needs increase financial support from Annex I parties in addition to technology transfer and local capacity building. There are four key technology-related requirements essential for transformation: (i) continued support of energy conversion efficiencies, (ii) carbon capture and storage &ldquo;CCS&rdquo; as a technology alternative that can be used in the future if proven economically feasible,(iii) co-utilization of fossil fuel and biomass in the same plants, and (iv) utilization of co-generation plants.</p> <p>Using advanced generations of nuclear reactors could be important to fill the gap between reducing fossil fuel dependence and the deployment of renewable energy. In addition, nuclear energy can be an important contributor in the future energy mix to stabilize CO<sub>2</sub> levels as energy demand continues to grow.</p> <p>Additional mitigation measures include the increase of the country&rsquo;s CO<sub>2</sub> absorptive capacity through plantation, maintaining suitable types of trees along road sides, the middle-island of inter-city and urban roads, and on irrigation and drainage canal banks. In addition, wood forests should use treated wastewater for irrigation.\"</p> <p>Mitigation Actions</p> <p>\"The two following tables present the most important mitigation actions across different sectors at the national level.\"</p> <p>Table 2.

This includes the implementation of the scope of the recently revised Forest Act as well as the National Forest Plan 2011. This legislative framework is supported by various Codes of Practice that governs forestry activities which will also be continually implemented using local resources.</li> <li>Forest monitoring and maintaining a high level of forest legality in Guyana are also areas that will continue, and which will see the GFC committing approximately 50 per cent of its total staff complement to field monitoring through its 54 forest monitoring stations countrywide. These will result in a maintained low rate of illegal logging which has been established to be less than 2 per cent of total production annually, and a maintained low rate of deforestation and forest degradation.</li> <li>Guyana is prepared to finalize and implement the Voluntary Partnership Agreement under EUFLEGT. Finalization is expected to be competed in 2016 and can provide independent accreditation of forest legality and management practices in Guyana&rsquo;s forest sector.\"</li> </ul> <p>Conditional Contributions</p> <p>\"Guyana can achieve emissions reductions through an Emissions Reductions Programme (ERP). The ERP in Forestry will include:</p> <ul> <li>Expand Reduced Impact Logging (RIL). Reducing the incidental and collateral damage during tree felling by about 10% and the damage from skid trails by about 35% (avoiding mid-size trees during skidding), could reduce the annual emissions by about 13.5% each year. This translates to a reduction of about 430 thousand tCO<sub>2</sub> per year and can target more predominantly the smaller concession category.</li> </ul> <p>This will result in a reduction from the annual emissions from forestry moving from 3.5M tCO<sub>2</sub> to 2.3M tCO<sub>2</sub>, a 20% reduction from historic levels for this driver, and an 11% reduction in the overall historic level.</p> <p>In Collaboration with Mining, the ERP will include:</p> <ul> <li>Land reclamation within the extractive sectors. This will provide an effective and replicable solution for increasing forest biomass and carbon stocks, while ensuring sustainable resource consumption.</li> <li>Mineral mapping and exploration.</li> </ul> <p>These initiatives will result in a reduction from the annual emissions from mining moving from 5.5M tCO<sub>2</sub> to 3.4M tCO<sub>2</sub>, a 30% reduction from historic levels for this driver, and a 17% reduction in overall historic level.\"</p> <p><strong>FLEGT </strong></p> <p>\"With the provision of resources, Guyana is prepared to build on its FLEGT initiative by further strengthening its implementation effort, and building EU FLEGT as a multilateral cooperation undertaking that creates synergies with the UK, EU, US, and other partners, and the various programmes that these partners have in place such as Procurement Rules, Lacey Act, FCS and certification processes, etc.\"</p> <p><strong>MRVS </strong></p> <p>\"A comprehensive and robust MRV system is being developed under the GFC. Guyana is willing to complete and maintain its MRVS if adequate financial resources are provided.\"</p> <p><strong>Avoided Deforestation</strong><p> <p>\"Guyana's proposal for a Reference Level for REDD+ is based on the Combined Reference Level approach, in which a global forest carbon emissions loss of 0.44%, as concluded by Baccini et. al. 2012 is used, along with Guyana's historic emissions level for the period 2001 to 2012, as established in this Proposal.</p> <p>Using a total carbon stock of forests in aboveground and belowground biomass of 19,197,411,268 t CO2, Guyana's Proposed Reference Level for its REDD+ Programme is 48.7M t CO2. Through this approach, Guyana can continue to avoid emissions in the amount of 48.7 Mt annually if adequate incentives are provided over the long term</p> <p>In summary, the Forest sector, in collaboration with mining initiatives in the forest estate, and including avoided emissions, can contribute a total of 52Mt Co<sub>2</sub> to the global mitigation effort.\"</p> <p><strong>Energy </strong></p> <p>Unconditional Contributions</p> <p>\"Guyana will continue to examine all sources of renewable energy - fossil fuels, wind, solar, bagasse and, of course, hydropower. Guyana will seek to construct and/or promote the construction of small hydro systems at suitable locations across the country. Government also plans to construct and/or promote the construction of small hydro systems in areas such as Moco Moco, Kato and Tumatumari, and will power all of the new townships, starting with Bartica, using alternative energy sources. Independent power producers and suppliers will be encouraged to construct energy farms and sell energy to the national grid.</p> <p>Energy efficient and renewable energy cook stoves have been demonstrated to provide sustainable energy solutions where appropriate. The Agencies will work closely with small farmers to encourage the use of small bio-digesters to reduce waste and produce biogas.</p> <p>Legislation has been amended to remove import duty and tax barriers for the importation of renewable energy equipment, compact fluorescent lamps and LED lamps to incentivize and motivate energy efficient behaviour.</p> <p>Guyana will continue to conduct energy assessments/audits and replace inefficient lighting at public, school, residential and commercial buildings with the objective of reducing energy consumption and attaining higher levels of energy efficiency.</p> <p>Public education and awareness programmes will continue to play a major role in providing consumers with information and tools for energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption and expenditure for energy.</p> <p>These unconditional contributions represent about one percent of the current energy mix.\"</p> <p>Conditional Contributions</p> <p>\"Feasibility studies for a large hydropower development in the Mazaruni region will be pursued with collaboration from the Government of Brazil. A 300MW hydropower plant to cater for Guyana's current and future energy needs should therefore cost between US$315 million to US$2,295 million.</p> <p>Options for interconnecting renewable energy generators to the grid will be reviewed and explored towards the implementation of grid-tied systems and net-metering platform. Once proven beneficial to all parties, grid-tie options can be encouraged as a means of reducing investment in fossil-based generators and meeting incremental demand from renewable energy sources.</p> <p>For supplying Hinterland communities, Guyana is interested in piloting small scale fermentation and distillation techniques for the production of ethanol and bio-fuels.</p> <p>If these conditional Contributions are fully funded and implemented, they can represent approximately 20 percent of Guyana's total energy mix.\"</p>"

This is an example of how Myanmar is resolving the need to mitigate climate change whilst also adapting to it. To reduce GHG emissions from the burning of crop residues in fields, the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation is implementing effective mitigation actions such as energy from crop residues, promoting the use of organic fertilisers, and methods to shorten the time of composting agricultural byproducts. The bio-char program is also being planned and will reduce GHG emissions to atmosphere as a result of less anaerobic decomposition in the production process. At the same time, this will increase crop production.</p> <p>&bull; Research and development is vital to find the means and methods of reducing GHG emissions from agriculture sector. To perform the systematic research necessary Myanmar requires the support of technical experts, access to tools and relevant apparatus. Technology transfer and assistance from experienced countries will therefore be required.

Qatar seeks to enhance the diversification of its economy away from hydrocarbon in consistent with decision 24/CP.18. Qatar has been contributing indirectly to the global efforts to mitigate climate change by exporting Liquefied Natural Gas as a clean energy.</p> <p>1. Energy Efficiency</p> <p>According to Qatar National Vision 2030, the energy industry is taking into consideration the impacts of its development and growth on the environment. Many programs and projects in the country are pursuing energy efficiency and process optimization. Although the existing capacity and technology is not enough to support improvement and upgrade, Qatar is in process of employing available resources to achieve energy efficiency.</p> <p>2. Clean Energy and Renewables</p> <p>Despite the abundance of gas which is clean energy, Qatar is heavily investing in other natural resources. Attempts have been made to utilize clean energy and renewable sources such as solar and wind power. Efforts have been made into solar energy generation with a view to becoming a regional supplier of solar-generated electricity. However, based on the harsh environment and weather conditions, utilizing such renewables as reliable power sources is very challenging due to the lack of access to high technology, which is necessary for using these sources effectively and efficiently. Yet, some national entities started considering solar and wind sources to generate electricity for small buildings aiming to open a new market, in the hope of strengthening the economic diversification. Utilizing clean energy and renewables is an adaptive precaution to climate change impacts that would open a window to diversify the economy and reduce emissions to the atmosphere from the fuel combustion. Some of clean energy and renewable sources are available, however, they cannot be utilized without the needed support; especially, technology transfer.</p> <p>3. Research and Development</p> <p>Qatar is highly committed to advancing research and development. Qatar has invested heavily in research and development in various areas including sustainable energy, in line with its National Research Strategy. Many research activities are being carried out in various fields, improving the environment to adapt with climate change impacts, utilizing clean energy and renewables, reducing emissions to the atmosphere and developing technologies that convert emissions into useful products. These research efforts consider economical validation, economic-diversification and efficiency.</p> <p>4. Education</p> <p>Qatar is investing heavily in education. Great steps have been taken to create a world-class education system that aims to build an environmentally aware society. Universities and research facilities have programs that center around environmental studies, including climate change. All in all, Qatar&rsquo;s emphasis on education is expected to produce graduates who are specialized in knowledge-based services, healthcare and green technologies. On the same grounds, young Qataris are always motivated to take advantage of the various opportunities for post-secondary education and training. These generations are encouraged to increase their involvement in the private sector by launching business training and capacity building programs. This involvement will, in turn, strengthen the new generation's capabilities and improve their analytical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurship to contribute to climate change efforts and sustainable development.</p> <p>5. Tourism</p> <p>Qatar has a long-term strategy towards advancing its tourism industry through a series of well-defined plans, programs, and policies developed according to international best practices, and following a nation-wide consultative process. The aim of this strategy is to reduce dependence on hydrocarbon resources by promoting sustainable tourism strategies, as well as to protect the country's economy from market fluctuations that can significantly affect its economic growth.\"</p>"

Therefore, contribution to the climate ambition will be integrated in the future policy to promote this plan. The INDC is thus driven by the aim to implement measures that accelerate the diversification process under paragraph 3.1 above (scenario 1). The following actions and plans will generate mitigation co-benefits and contribute to economic diversification:</p> <p>1. Energy Efficiency: implement measures and initiativesthat will promote, encourage and support actions in generating mitigation co-benefits in energy efficiency. Strengthen the Saudi Energy Efficiency Program and expand its focus. Currently, the program focuses on three main sectors, namely industry, building and transportation that collectively account for over 90% of the energy demand in the Kingdom. Support initiatives that will produce far-reaching cobenefits, such as the introduction of efficiency standards in the building and transportation sectors as well as the implementation of energy efficiency measures, in various industrial establishments. Encourage and expedite the conversion of single cycle power plants to combined cycle power plants.</p> <p>2. Renewable energies: Invest and implement ambitious programs for renewable energy to increase its contribution to the energy mix. The scope will include solar PV, solar thermal, wind and geothermal energy and waste to energy systems. A competitive procurement process for renewable energy is currently under preparation and evaluation.</p> <p>3. Carbon Capture and Utilization/Storage: promote and encourage actions in this area. As part of itssustainability programme, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia plans to build the world&rsquo;s largest carbon capture and use plant. This initiative aims to capture and purify about 1,500 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> a day for use in other petrochemical plants. Saudi Arabia will operate on pilot testing basis, a Carbon Dioxide &ndash; Enhanced Oil Recovery (CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR) demonstration project to assess the viability of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration in oil reservoirs and any other useful applications. Forty million standard cubic feet a day of CO<sub>2</sub> that will be captured, processed and injected into the Othmaniya oil reservoir. This pilot project has comprehensive monitoring and surveillance plans. The success of this pilot will determine the extent this program will contribute to the Kingdom's ambition in addressing climate change.</p> <p>4. Utilization of gas: Encourage investments on exploring and producing natural gas to significantly increase its contribution to the national energy mix. The success on realizing the Mitigation co-benefit ambition in this area will depend on the success of exploring and developing natural gas.</p> <p>5. Methane recovery and flare minimization: Actions will be taken to conserve, recover and reuse hydrocarbon resources and minimize flaring and fugitive emissions.\"</p>"

Thus, these instruments allow the incorporation of climate change management in making development decisions in the medium and long term, and facilitate compliance with the objectives laid down in this iNDC.</p><p>Colombia&acute;s iNDC seeks to give greater participation to the territories and sectors at the local level to prioritize and design their own climate change strategies, with a differentiated approach that takes into account regional circumstances. This aims at reconciling \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" strategies with a view to establishing enhanced coordination and participation of different stakeholders at the different government levels and links in the value chains of the different sectors.</p><p>To fulfill its mitigation goal, Colombia has prioritized mitigation measures through (8) Sectorial Mitigation Action Plans (SMAPs) that aim to maximize the carbon-efficiency of economic activities at the national and sectorial levels and in turn contribute to social and economic development. These plans were developed under the CLCDS framework and were approved by the relevant sectorial Ministries (Agriculture and Rural Development, Commerce, Industry and Tourism, Transport, Housing, City and Territory and Mines and Energy). Mitigation measures have also been identified in the land use change sector, with processes under the REDD + Strategy and the Amazon Vision Program, among others.</p><p>Since 2013 the country has been working on developing a system for monitoring, reporting and verification for GHG emission reductions and climate financing.

          "value": "<p>\"As a pioneer country in the search for alternative ways for decarbonizing the economy, Costa Rica has a range of political instruments, both in mitigation and adaptation. In 2011, Costa Rica presented its Technological Needs Assessment (TNA) which posted a strategy for technological transfer and access to support greenhouse gas mitigation (GHG), and reduce vulnerability to adverse effects of climate change. In this evaluation, the following sectors and climate actions where prioritized: Public Transportation Integration and Decongestion, and Energy Conservation and Efficiency. In adaptation, two approaches were proposed, the adaptive co-management at the watershed level and detailed (sub-national) climate change scenarios. One of the approaches proposed with impacts both in mitigation and adaptation: Sustainable Agricultural Production.</p><p>Costa Rica has been reforming the structure of its Executive branch, especially, through the Environmental Law of 1995, which created the National Environmental Council. Almost a decade after this law, in 2014, a new structure for the executive branch was proposed, creating, among other organizations, the Environment, Energy, Sea and Land Use Sector Council, which brings together 14 autonomous and government organizations responsible for environmental policy. This Sectoral Council for the Environment has climate change and land use planning as its cornerstones. A Climate Change Department under the Strategic Planning Department of the Environment and Energy Ministry, will work as a Secretariat to the Inter-ministerial Council for Climate Change, facilitating coordination between ministries to implement national and sectorial climate policies. The Inter-ministerial Council for Climate Change was created through the Executive Decree #35669 of January 6th of 2010, which defines the MINAE’s Organic Regulation and appoints MINAE’s Climate Change Department as the entity in charge of implementing climate change policies.</p><p>The 2015-2018 National Development Plan sets the main policy objectives for the Solis Rivera Administration. In matters of climate change, the National Development Plan proposes as a strategic objective the promotion of actions against global climate change, through citizen participation, technology changes, innovation, research, and knowledge to guarantee security, human safety and the country’s competitiveness.</p><p>For such purpose, under the 2015-2018 National Development Plan, there are two relevant results relevant to climate change policies:</p><p>1. Reduce climate change’s impact and variability, increasing the adaptive capacity and disaster risk management, providing better resilience to vulnerable sectors.</p><p>2. Support the key sector emission reduction activities (transport, energy, agriculture, solid waste) to drive the low emission development transformation process to achieve the county’s Carbon-neutral goal within National Contribution framework under the Climate Change Convention Framework of the United Nations.</p><p>As part of its “Open Government” policy, during 2015, a number of sector-wide dialogues were organized by Costa Rica’s government, bringing together key stakeholders to discuss the country’s greenhouse effect gas reduction goals, within the INDCs context. Theses dialogues have enabled a clearer definitions of the sectoral plans and programs needed to accomplish the country’s climate action goals.</p><p>The Climate Change Policy derived from the acquired commitments within this National Contribution, has a multi-sector focus, since we all agree that climate change, more than just and environmental problem, is a development matter which requires effective climate actions through activities in the transportation, energy, forestry, agricultural, livestock and waste management sectors. This will require strengthening the inter-sectorial coordination platforms, such as, the National Environmental Council, the Environment, Energy, Sea and Land Use Sectorial Council, and the Inter-ministerial Council for Climate Change.</p><p>The VIIth National Energy Plan 2015-2030, sets a clear path towards a low emission development pathways by strengthening policies on energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energies. Confirms the country’s commitment to accomplish better energy efficiency, both in energy use and fuel end-use. In 2015, the Joint Commission between the Ministry of Environment and Energy and the Ministry of Agriculture was created to develop a common Agro-Environmental Agenda. The Vice-Ministries of Energy and Transportation have created an Ad-Hoc coordination mechanism which has allowed a better implementation of energy efficiency and mitigation policies within the transport sector. This change, within the country’s energy sector, was fully supported during the sectorial round tables. MINAE has also launched its Biodiversity National Strategy, which will have important components and relevant action to the country’s mitigation and adaptation goals. The National Action Plan was also used to fight land degradation, which will have significant contributions to rural environment management in mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>As previously mentioned, Costa Rica reserves the right to use market mechanisms to accomplish its mitigation goals. MINAE’s Executive Decree #37926-MINAE of November 11th of 2013, creates a Carbon Board, and decrees the Operation and Regulation of the Domestic Carbon Market, and MINAE’s decree #39099-MINAE of September 10th of 2015, outlining the Structure, Guidelines and Requirements to introduce actions into the Domestic Carbon Market and its digital access. These market mechanisms will be restructured to optimize them into an inter-sectorial implementation mechanism complementary to the previously mentionedinstitutional management driven by National Contribution and the Post 2020 International Climate Regime.</p><p>In summary, the National Contribution will be implemented by the following entities:</p><p>1. Inter-Ministerial Council for Climate Change, which will allow to discuss, define, and follow up on climate change policies.</p><p>2. Ad-Hoc Operational Coordination Mechanism such as: Joint Commissions (agriculture and forestry, transportation and energy), which will coordinate the inter-sectorial implementation agendas under the National Climate Change Strategy.</p><p>3. MINAE’s Climate Change Department, in charge of coordinating the implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy and supervising the definition of technical standards, closely coordinated with other sectorial directions and institutions related to MINAE (Energy Department, National Meteorological Institute, National Forestry Finance Fund, National Conservation Areas System, National Forestry Administration, among others).</p><p>4. The Climate Change Scientific Council will be created to advise the Environmental Sector Council, particularly its lead Ministry (MINAE). This Council will include international and national experts and academics, as well as members of the National Meteorological Institute (IMN), from the National Agricultural Technology Institute (INTA), from the National Council of Universities (CONARE), and from the National Geo-Environmental Information Center (CENIGA).</p><p>5. The Climate Change Citizen Consultation Council, which will create a permanent citizen participation forum on climate change, with wide private sector participation, organized civil society and academia to provide continuity to subjects and workgroups emerging from the sectorial forums in climate change.\"</p><p>"

The provisions of this Climate Change Policy are being integrated/ mainstreamed in environmental, social and economic policies and legislation in the Country. In particular, the Policy&rsquo;s provision will be integrated in the National Green Growth Plan and Implementation Roadmap, which is currently under development and will be launched in 2016 and will cover six sectors (energy, water, waste, transport, tourism and agriculture). The INDC proposed for Jordan is envisioned as the core element of the said National Green Growth Plan. This helps dual implementation of the INDCs and the Country&rsquo;s green growth plan. The National Committee on Climate Change is mandated to monitor the progress in the implementation of the Climate Change Policy on the national level and thus the INDC. A large share of the objectives of the Policy will be implemented through sector strategies under the responsibility of the sector&rsquo;s ministries (energy, water, agriculture, health, and others). Their progress will be monitored by each involved sector on the basis of the specific monitoring framework adopted in the respective sector&rsquo;s policies and strategies.\"</p><p>Medium - to long-term planning process:</p><p>\"The national implementation will be based on the time frame of the commitments, which is until end of 2030 for the GHGs reduction targets and until 2025 for the other packages of mitigation actions (and tied KPI-based targets) based on timeframe adopted by Jordan 2025 Vision. The GHGs reduction targets&rsquo; achievement will be tracked through the information in Jordan&rsquo;s national inventories and Biennial Update Report (BURs). The preparation of the first BUR for Jordan will start in 2016 and is expected to be completed in late 2017. For the other packages of mitigation actions (and tied KPI-based targets) proposed in Jordan 2025, the Vision has set a &ldquo;Performance Management Framework for Implementation&rdquo; to assure that the policies, measures, and KPIs articulated in the Vision will be fulfilled. In each section of the 2020 Vision, a number of KPIs have been chosen to measure progress, and where possible, objective and internationally used KPIs have been selected. This is to ensure transparency in measuring progress. The governmental executive programs that will be prepared based on this Vision will measure progress in the short and medium terms. The time-period covered by the Vision was divided into three phases, and each phase will be evaluated to see what has, and what has not been, achieved in order to ensure continuing the implementation of policies and initiatives of the said Vision. The Prime Minister&rsquo;s Delivery Unit was re-established to follow up the most important initiatives proposed and overcome the obstacles facing the Vision&rsquo;s implementation in order to assure commitment and effective implementation.\"</p>"

An INDC Preparation Team has been appointed, with representatives from relevant ministries that will be responsible for the implementation of the specific actions identified.</p> <p>This INDC (and its future revisions) are to be an integral part of the climate change architecture of Cambodia. Hence its implementation will be aligned with that of Cambodia's national climate change policy, and not create unnecessary duplication.</p> <p>There are a number of existing and planned domestic processes for delivering, supporting, and monitoring climate change policy in Cambodia, thereby facilitating the successful implementation of the actions captured in the INDC. It is clear that these strategies and plans will need to be revised once the timeframes expire, after having assessed the progress achieved under them.</p> <p>Cambodia made extensive progress in developing processes for implementing climate change interventions over the last decade. The overarching development plan for the country, the National Strategic Development Plan (2014-2018), states the importance of implementing Cambodia's Climate Change Strategic Plan (2014-2023) and contains indicators to track implementation of climate change actions. Further, the INDC development is guided by theGreen Growth Road Map (2009), developed with the aim to support the achievement of middle-income country status by 2030. The roadmap also has priority projects for the longer term i.e. 2020-2030.</p> <p>Cambodia intends to support the initial delivery of the INDC mainly through the implementation of the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan (CCCSP) (2014 &ndash; 2023). The following strategic priorities aim to develop Cambodia towards a green, low-carbon, climate-resilient, equitable, sustainable and knowledge-based society:</p> <p>(1) The line ministries have developed Sectoral Climate Change Strategic Plans and Action Plans (SCCSPs and SCCAPs) are aligned with CCCSP and cover all the main sectors of relevance to climate change, where identified in the NAPA and National Communications under the UNFCCC. Cambodia is also actively mainstreaming climate change resilience into sub-national planning and finance systems.</p> <p>(2) Specifically on adaptation, Cambodia has undertaken initiatives to mainstream adaptation into national development, and in specific sectors such as in the agriculture, forestry and human health sectors, as well as coastal zone management. In addition to the CCSP and the SCCSPs and SCCAPs, Cambodia has developed the National Adaptation Programme of Action to Climate Change (2006), in which coping mechanisms to hazards and climate change impacts are identified, as well as key adaptation needs.</p> <p>(3) The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process is being used in Cambodia to strengthen the ongoing climate change adaptation processes through cross-sectoral programming and implementation at national and sub-national levels. It may in turn inform future climate change strategies, financing frameworks, and national development planning and budgeting.</p> <p>(4) Forestry related actions would be implemented as part of the national REDD+ Strategy. Cambodia is developing an operational National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS), Reference Emission Level to more accurately quantify GHG impacts of actions in this sector. This will form the basis of implementing and accounting for the forestry actions post 2020. Further, Forest Reference Emission Levels and Forest Reference Levels 11 (FREL/FRL) and a Safeguards Information System (SIS) will be used to account for the emissions reduced via the implementation of activities identified from 2016-2020.</p> <p>Cambodia has already taken steps to ensure that its monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system includes indicators to measure progress, including INDC implementation, both for adaptation and mitigation. The monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system will build on the greenhouse gas inventory. In particular, continued support to develop the REDD+ MRV system is required, in order to enable Cambodia to move towards the third phase of REDD+ where it will receive performance-based payments. M&E for adaptation is currently carried out at project-level. A national M&E framework will be developed, while activities to operationalise it in key sectors have already begun.</p> <p>The Annex to this INDC summarises the prioritised actions on climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the proposed related planning and implementation processes. It is expected that there will be stock-taking of progress and lessons learned in 2018 for the development of the action plans for the subsequent period.\"</p>"

Political guidance has been sought from the highest institutional level within the Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. MOECAF has acted as INDC focal point, facilitating the inputs from other line ministries. The INDC has been prepared through the review of key documents and a government drafting and validation process with all line ministries, which included: one kick-off meeting in March-April 2015, which highlighted priority areas; three interministerial consultations between April and July 2015 (which refined possible options), and a final validation workshop in August 2015. In addition, specific advanced technical meetings were conducted in priority sectors such as the Ministries of Environmental Conservation and Forestry; Energy, Electric Power, Rail Transportation, Transport, Agriculture and Irrigation, Science and Technology, Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement and Industry. Following the consultation process a final round of ministerial consultations was carried out by MOECAF before the INDC was submitted to the Union Government&rsquo; cabinet for approval before submission to the UNFCCC. MOECAF also worked with the MCCA for technical facilitation of the process.</p> <p>Technical assistance for the development of the INDC has been received from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and delivered by Ricardo-AEA Ltd of the UK, and MCCA. Financial support by the Global Environment Facility via the UNEP and technical advice provided by UNEP-DTU partnership was also received to facilitate the preparation of the INDC.\"</p> <p><strong>Implementation Plan </strong></p> <p>\"Five main aspects are crucial for successful implementation of the INDC, and international support is required for each aspect. The first is the development of a clear strategy and co-ordination plan which assigns responsibilities and sets deadlines for activities. The second and third, are separate needs assessments for mitigation and adaptation activities respectively which have to be carried out to identify specific requirements and gaps in technology, finance and to identify capacity building requirements in both areas. This has been detailed out in section 5 - Means of implementation. Fourth, mobilising resources for policy development, identification and purchase of suitable technologies for planned actions will be required. Implementation of projects can then begin and finally the fifth aspect of the plan will need to be implemented; a monitoring system will assist with the implementation of the plan at many stages, as outlined below.</p> <p>A costing exercise including considering short, medium and long term priorities will be conducted to ensure the implementation plan has the necessary resources to deliver on intended contributions, intended actions and future policy development. The coordination of different ministries and stakeholders will be needed at all stages to successfully implement the plan.</p> <p>Therefore, for implementation, the following activities will be necessary:</p> <ul> <li>The Union Government&rsquo;s cabinet will identify and mandate one of the existing national interministerial committees to supervise and foster the implementation of the INDC. This may be the National Environmental Conservation Committee or National Energy Management Committee for example.</li> <li>Under this arrangement, MOECAF should serve as focal-point for coordination with the guidance of the selected national committee. MOECAF will assist relevant ministries to identify what is needed to implement identified mitigation and adaptation actions, as well as to develop Myanmar&rsquo;s ability to attract climate finance. MOECAF&rsquo;s role will also be to assist with the monitoring of the progress achieved by the line ministries in charge of the respective proposed actions and sectoral strategies outlined in the INDC.</li> <li>Myanmar would like to put in place a monitoring framework so that the selected national committee, through its ministry focal-point, will be able to further define financial and technical means of implementation most accurately, to measure progress on a regular basis and to issue policy guidance to the respective line ministries as needed. Myanmar recognises that high quality Measurement, Reporting and Verification-MRV system is the cornerstone of project management as it demonstrates progress against plans, allows responsible entities to steer activities to achieve set policy goals and provides valuable lessons for improving future design and implementation of activities. The set-up of an MRV system for Myanmar&rsquo;s INDC implementation will require the clear allocation of responsibilities, e.g.to the implementing agency concerned, the building of capacities within the relevant agency and relevant stakeholders providing data or performing other MRV activities is also necessary. The set-up of clear processes for data collection, evaluation, quality assurance and quality control, reporting and documentation/ archiving. These activities will require international support in the form of capacity building and financing. Where possible, Myanmar will use existing institutional structures, capacities and processes as a basis for this MRV system.</li> <li>The MRV system will have to include a component on costs and financial analysis. For this to be developed, Myanmar requires financial and technical assistance in order that the MRV system can efficiently, effectively and economically: <ul> <li>Update and provide financial data to support of the Ministry of Finance and the relevant line-ministries responsible for implementing identified actions</li> <li>Collect information to provide updates on project progress on a regular basis, by establishing clear and straightforward reporting procedures for the line ministries in charge of the policies and actions which fall within their mandate to develop</li> <li>Make the process of completing UNFCCC National Communications and other data requests with respect to emissions data a more efficient and accurate process</li> <li>Provide analysis of observed changes in climate, as well as providing data for the update of models and projections for projects implemented with domestic resources and / or international partnerships o Can continue to improve collection of sectoral data and other key information.</li> <li>In addition, the development of the National Climate Change Strategy and its associated action plans will provide a platform for the coordination of stakeholders involved in the implementation of the INDC.</li> <li>Concerning adaptation, a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) will be developed to plan, cost, and guide actions to meet adaptation objectives and priorities.

The Framework of National Appropriate Mitigation Actions and the National Adaptation Planning process being undertaken by Government provides a good basis for long- term adaptation and mitigation programming and mainstreaming of climate change adaptation/mitigation into the existing national planning processes.</p> <p>Sudan has taken concrete actions and showed political will to address and minimize the risks posed by climate change to its communities, natural resources and economy by identifying and implementing adaptation measures while pursing low-carbon development strategies to spur its local and national economy in a sustainable manner. Sudan&rsquo;s Initial National Communication (INC) to the UNFCCC identified agriculture, water resources and public health as most vulnerable sectors to climate change and climate variability. SSNC (2012) further identified coastal zones as an increasingly vulnerable sector that needs to be considered in climate change adaptation actions.</p> <p>With the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) Sudan&rsquo;s adaptation engagement was brought to a different level (2007) as it initiated building a solid base to take systematic adaptation planning and implementation, including through stakeholder engagement, raising public awareness, and building individual and institutional capacities in the Sudanese context that set the basis for further adaptation action. Sudan&rsquo;s NAPA is the first adaptation plan prepared to enable Sudan to access funds made available through the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) to implement real adaptation actions on ground. The overall goal of the NAPA preparation process was to identify urgent and immediate activities to address climate variability and climate change within the context of the country&rsquo;s economic development priorities. Sudan&rsquo;s NAPA identified 32 urgent and immediate adaptation initiatives in the four states River Nile, Gedarif, South Darfur and North Kordofan, representing five different ecological zones.</p> <p>In addition, in response to the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF, 2010), Sudan launched a process for a NAP in line with its National Implementation Strategy (INC, 2003). Sudan is currently in the final stage of developing its NAP which is currently subject to Ministerial endorsement. Sudan&rsquo;s NAP aims to integrate climate risks into all national development planning processes and reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, by building adaptive capacity and resilience. As such, Sudan&rsquo;s NAP process includes assessment of vulnerability and adaptation in all Sudan&rsquo;s States, covering the main development sectors, such as water, agriculture, health and coastal zone.</p> <p>Sudan has conducted its Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) for adaption and mitigation in 2013. For mitigation the TNAs covers energy, industry and forestry sectors while two priority sectors have been covered with regard to technology for adaptation, namely agriculture and water sectors. The TNAs resulted in a Technology Action Plan (TAP), which includes some priorities with regard to technology transfer for enhancing national actions on adaptation and mitigation</p> <p>At national level line ministries developed climate change related polices such as the Agricultural Revival Program (ARP) of 2008 &ndash;2011 and the five year economic reform programme 2015- 2019. The Forest Policy, (2006) supports climate resilient livelihoods via encouraging income diversification, facilitating microfinance and providing access to land (Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, 2012). The Natural Resource Management policy is part of the development plan of the state, which is in line with Sudan's national policy. The policy provides clear guidelines for local rehabilitation. This made local communities becoming more aware of the importance of sustainable resources management. Mainstreaming adaptation and enhancing adaptive capacity could be increased by encouraging partnerships between informal processes and formal interventions to facilitate adaptation.</p> <p>In terms of mitigation, Sudan aims towards achieving quicker economic growth rates in a sustainable manner. In line with this Sudan intends to undertake measures across a number of sectors of its economy to pursue low-carbon development, guided by the long-term national development policies, plans and strategies, which are clearly stated in different national development planning documents such as the Strategic Plan document 2007-2033. In addition, it incorporates the outcome of further analysis and consultation to enhance Sudan&rsquo;s existing plans, in particular the assessment of the potential economic sectors that lead towards a low carbon development strategy.

This will be a recurring process, to ensure that the INDC is indeed being implemented and is updated regularly. The process put in place for this purpose will make use of existing frameworks:</p> <p>The Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Employment Promotion (SCAPE) 2013-2017 takes account of climate change, namely via the actions listed in its paragraph 2.3.5.3, &ldquo;Environment, sustainable natural resources management and living conditions&rdquo;, for area 5. These relate to the:</p> <p>(a) Maintenance of the ecosystems&rsquo; environmental services and the preservation of biodiversity;&nbsp;</p> <p>(b) Sustainable management of land, catastrophes and natural resources;</p> <p>(c) Fight against climate change, which the Government recognizes as a major preoccupation, particularly:</p> <p>(i) the reinforcement of the institutional framework for implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the adaptation and mitigation measures for the main development sectors,<br />(ii) the strengthening of the national multi-sector, multi-actor dialogue,<br />(iii) the updating and implementation of the National Adaptation Programme of Action for climate change, and<br />(iv) the definition and implementation of a low carbon emissions development strategy to engage the country in long term mitigation actions;</p> <p>(d) Sustainable management of the coastal zone; and</p> <p>(e) Sustainable management of living conditions, including housing and waste.&nbsp;</p> <p>It should also be noted that climate change has been targeted as one of the five risks identified for the implementation of SCAPE. However, provisions have also been introduced to account for mitigation actions on the said risks. The INDC provides a response to that concern.</p> <p>All the national programmes, strategies and plans have prepared planning, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. These different documents include the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) process, the National Environmental Policy, the final NEAP document, the National Environmental Management Programme, the National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS), the National Strategy for Reducing the Risk of Catastrophes in Togo, the National Programme for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) (2010- 2050), the National Medium Term Priority Framework (NMTPF) for Togo (2010-2015), and Adapting Agriculture in Togo to Climate Change (ADAPT).</p> <p>Togo has a number of national committees: the National Climate Change Committee, the National NAPA Committee, the National NAMA Committee and the Designated National CDM Authority. All of these have monitoring and evaluation bodies that the INDC will be able to utilize.</p> <p>Further, in the context of the institutionalization of its process of developing national communications, Togo will be relying on certain institutions that have quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems, and with which the Ministry of the Environment has established a partnership. This involves the following structures responsible for GHG inventories and mitigation measures in the concerned sectors:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>National Graduate School of Engineering (ENSI) for the energy sector;</li> <li>Graduate School of Agricultural Engineering (ESA) for the agricultural sector;</li> <li>Laboratory of Botany and Plant Ecology (LBEV) for the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector;</li> <li>Laboratory of Atmospheric Chemistry (LCA), which is responsible for compiling the GHG inventories and producing the TCN document; and</li> <li>Laboratory for the Management, Treatment and Recovery of Waste (GTVD).</li> </ul> <p>All this will be supplemented by the development of a monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system that will include the adaptation and mitigation indicators defined in existing legislation, policies, strategies, programmes and plans, in order to better monitor the INDC&rsquo;s implementation.&nbsp;</p> <p>The implementation calendar is included in Annex V.\"</p> <p>See Togo's full INDC submission for Annex V \"Several programmes demonstrating Togo's commitment.\"</p> <p>Implementation methods</p> <p>\"This section describes the necessary support in the form of financing, capacity-building, technology transfers and others, linked to the implementation of the INDC. The provided information covers adaptation and mitigation and could help international partners to better understand the needs in order to target their support for Togo.</p> <p>All of this information is contained in the technology needs assessment documents, the national climate strategies and actions plans, the communication strategy for climate change and the transition to the green economy, capacity-building needs assessments, investment needs assessments, national communications, NAMAs, the NAPA, and the PNIERN (National Investment Programme for the Environment and Natural Resources), in addition to being summarized in the first part of this document.</p> <p>a) Capacity-building</p> <p>Satisfaction of the identified needs will be decisive in reinforcing the effectiveness of implementation of the INDC. Real efforts have been made to build both personal and institutional capacities during the First, Second and Third National Communications. However, many needs will still have to be met before achieving the national skills and expertise that will be necessary in order to carry out climate change initiatives successively and for the long term.</p> <p>In order to meet its development and adaptation challenges and to implement its roadmap, Togo must first build up its capacities. This will need to remedy the following, in particular:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Insufficient reliable climate data for a realistic analysis and interpretation of climate change;</li> <li>Weak technical, institutional and legal capacities required to support the development of the horizontal integration of adaptation at the national, sub-national and local levels; and</li> <li>Shortage of financial resources to support the implementation of the adaptation and mitigation initiatives.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Cost: US $0.4 billion.</p> <p>The institutionalization process that is now under way will make it possible to train a larger number of experts and to reinforce and provide tools to research and excellence centres on climate change. Further, the national INDC committee will become a standing committee, endowed with appropriate means so that it can fulfil its role effectively. A long term coordination team will also be created to monitor and evaluate the INDC activities.</p> <p>b) Technology transfers</p> <p>The technology transfer needs were identified and can essentially be summarized as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Produce and popularise energy-efficient stoves using wood, charcoal and gas among all of the country&rsquo;s social strata (a process that will need to begin with subsidies or appropriate tax benefits);</li> <li>Promote renewable energies (thermal solar, photovoltaic, micro-hydraulic, wind, etc.) by facilitating access to those technologies and training the populations on how to use and manage them; and</li> <li>Promote internal expertise and good practices for safeguarding the forest cover and fighting bush fires. Cost: US $0.5 billion.</li> </ul> <p>c) Financial support</p> <p>To implement its INDC, Togo will need three point five four(3.54) billion US dollars, one point five four (1.54) billion of which for adaptation, one point ten (1.10) billion of which for mitigation, zero point five (0.5) billion for technology transfers and zero point four (0.4) billion for capacity-building.</p> <p>These estimates represent additional financing needs over and above the cost of any national decisions that would have been implemented in any case, in view of the defined national priorities.\"</p>"

This process has gathered momentum since publication of the Lima COP20 decisions defining the rules for achieving the INDCs and for their content. The consultation process continued until validation.&rdquo;</p><p>INDC implementation:</p><p>&ldquo;In its standard development agenda, Tunisia is already striving to mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions in all of the key sectors which generate them: (i) The country has continuously pursued a proactive energy management policy for some 30 years and has one of the lowest energy intensities in the Middle East/ North Africa region, (ii) It has achieved major accomplishments in the reforestation and preservation of forested ecosystems, which are confirmed by the finding in the 2010 greenhouse gas inventory that the entire Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector is a net CO<sub>2</sub> absorber, (iii) It has always set store by improvement of agricultural productivity(including livestock) and optimization of the use of inputs, (iv) It has established the systematic introduction of controlled landfills and has, since 2006, launched Ministry of Sustainable Development projects for degasification and gas flaring across the country's eight main landfills.</p><p>Tunisia was one of the pioneering countries in the drafting of several nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs)[1], thereby standing ready to sign a new climate agreement, and was one of the first non-Annex I countries to submit its first biennial report (31 December 2014).</p><p>These numerous initiatives prove Tunisia's determination to advance swiftly beyond the already proactive baseline which it has adopted for a number of years and to set out on a virtuous and ambitious path towards mitigating its emissions of greenhouse gases, drawing both on its own resources and on those of the international community.</p><p>As part of its contribution to tackling climate change issues, Tunisia will step up its efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in several sectors:</p><p>The energy sector: The aim of the mitigation plan is to intensify the promotion of energy efficiency in all consumer sectors and for all energy usages. Around 20 energy efficiency actions have been included in the calculation of avoidable emissions, covering the entire industrial, building, transport and agricultural sectors. This should allow primary energy demand to decrease by some 30 per cent by 2030, compared to the baseline.</p><p>The plan also advocates increasing the use of renewable energies, not least through the Tunisian Solar Plan (PST). This will raise the share of renewable energies in electricity production to 14 per cent in 2020 and to 30 per cent in 2030, whereas it stood at only 4 per cent in 2015.</p><p>To achieve this, the plan will aim to achieve an installed renewable energy capacity of 3,815 MW in 2030, including 1,755 MW for wind power, 1,610 MW for solar photovoltaic (PV) and 450 MW for concentrated solar power (CSP).</p><p>With regard to solar heating, Tunisia intends to triple the solar water heater distribution rate, which will exceed 220 m&sup2; of collectors per 1,000 inhabitants in 2030, compared to 73 in 2015.</p><p>Industrial processes sector: The mitigation plan includes the use of a NAMA in the cement industry from 2016 onwards and access of this sector to carbon markets from 2021 onwards.</p><p>Agriculture, Forestry and Changes in Land Use: The mitigation plan aims to intensify the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption capacities of forestry and arboriculture by stepping up reforestation and by consolidating and increasing carbon reserves in forest and pastoral environments. The carbon footprint for agriculture will also be improved by using practices that generate fewer emissions, such as optimizing the diets of domestic animals, promoting biological agriculture or conservation-oriented agricultural practices, or recovering energy from animal waste.</p><p>Waste: The mitigation plan provides for the implementation, from 2016, of a plan to install facilities to transform solid waste into RDF (refuse derived fuel) intended for cement facilities, as well as a programme for introducing degasification systems in controlled landfills. It is planned to recover electricity from captured gases, at least at the main landfills. This energy option is covered in the low-carbon scenario for the energy sector.</p><p>The mitigation plan in the sanitation sector provides in particular for the installation of solar PV capacity at water treatment plants (STEPs), biogas digesters for electricity production and a reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of industrial wastewater.&rdquo;</p><p>[1] Five NAMA proposals have already been developed: (i) NAMA Cement, (ii) NAMA Buildings (iii) NAMA Electricity Sector, (iv) NAMA Forests, and (v) NAMA Sanitation.</p><p>Monitoring INDC implementation:</p><p>\"To ensure the success and efficiency of the actions which make up its contribution, Tunisia will establish a rigorous system for monitoring and evaluating the actions and results achieved.

Les mesures cibl&eacute;es concernent la protection des espaces forestiers, la d&eacute;forestation, le reboisement, afforestation, l&rsquo;agroforesterie et l&rsquo;arboriculture tout en investissant les efforts n&eacute;cessaires pour r&eacute;duire la consommation de bois provenant de for&ecirc;ts.

The guidelines and the 2006 IPCC software were used to estimate emissions. The changes between the IPCC categories were determined by remote sensing supported by traditional mapping and other means such as forest inventories to track key variables responsible for emissions and removals. This last set of terms are:<ul> <li>The reduction of wood collected for various uses;</li> <li>Curbing deforestation rates;</li> <li>Better management of forests;</li> <li>Preservation of protected areas;</li> <li>The conservation of forest reserves;</li> <li>Agroforestry;</li> <li>Arboriculture;</li> <li>Reforestation;</li> <li>Better control of forest and prairie fires.</li> </ul> <p>The forestry sector was particularly targeted because it is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases and it also offers a great possibility for carbon sequestration in the country. The targeted measures concern the protection of forested areas, deforestation, reforestation, afforestation, agroforestry and arboriculture while concentrating efforts to reduce the consumption of wood from forests. A holistic approach was conceived for sustainable forestry taking into consideration the needs of the population for its fuelwood and other needs. Thus Comoros plans to reforest approximately 12,000 ha during the period from 2018 to 2030. The area under agroforestry and arboriculture will evolve at a rate of 200 ha per year from 2018 to 2030. The existing protected areas will be extended to 50 000 ha in 2030.</p>"

The sectors covered were: Energy Demand: Electricity Generation; Transport; Industrial Processes; Agriculture; and Waste.

Following a prioritization of all possible mitigation actions, emissions projections were made based on assumed economic growth, changes in population, energy supplies and prices, as well as the adoption of new technologies and the impacts of government policies. Further, it was decided that to balance pursuing an aggressive mitigation target with realistic outcomes for the iNDC, projected emissions reductions from the Energy, Electricity Generation and Transportation sectors only will be considered. Uncertainties over the permanence of projected emissions reductions from the Agro-Forestry, Reforestation and LULUCF sectors, and the absence of decisive international action to phase out HFCs persuaded the exclusion of related projected emissions reductions in this analysis.

The Energy Efficiency (EE) scenario is one where the annual energy intensity drops by 20% compared to 10% in the Reference scenario. This scenario is based on the Reference scenario (scenario 1) with a GDP growth rate of 5% per year, except that in Industry the energy intensity will decrease by 20% per year in all the sub-sectors of industry for motor fuel uses, electricity specific uses and thermal uses except in Agriculture and Others in Manufacturing. This is due to energy efficiency improvement and technology innovation which are likely to occur in the next 25 years.</p><ul><li>The implementation of a National Energy Efficiency Programme includes the following activities:</li><li>Promotion of energy-efficient appliances: target of10% energy savings in 2035</li><li>Promotion of solar water heating: target of 80% of needs in Households, and 80% in Services by 2035,</li><li>New Regulations on the use of air-conditioning, target of 20% energy savings in the service sector,</li><li>New Building Code for Household dwellings (features natural ventilation, roof insulation,..), target of 50% energy savings on fans &amp; AC in households by 2035,</li><li>Promotion of cogeneration (production of hot water from waste heat from electricity generation) in hotels, target to cover 20% of hot water needs by 2035.</li></ul><p>It is assumed that for the period of the study 2010-2035, the population will grow at a constant rate of 1% per year, corresponding to the annual average growth rate (AAGR) for the preceding 10 years.

Similarly, the emission factor = 0.65936 tCO<sub>2</sub> /MWh has been applied to obtain the emission reductions associated with demand side energy efficiency gains.

Using a target of 30% reduction in fuel use, which is expected to produce a proportional decrease in GHG emissions, the total emissions arising from road transport is expected to be 116.96 ktCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030. This target corresponds to a reduction in emission of 50.13 ktCO<sub>2</sub> in 2030.

Secondly, the Department of Forestry and local communities will continue to plant and care for trees annually. The implementation of renewable energy sources will contribute to greenhouse gas emission reductions of 45.6 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2020, 78.5 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2025 and 104 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2030 whilst afforestation will contribute reductions of 220.3 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2020, 275.4 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2025 and 330.5 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2030 (see Figure 3).\"</p> <p><strong> Emission Reductions at the Sectorial Level</strong></p> <p><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">\"</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\">Reductions in the Agricultural Sector</span><br />Under the Agriculture sector, two conditional mitigation options (NERICA Rice production and Rice efficiency) have been assessed and reported on in this INDC (see Figure 4). For production of NERICA upland production in place of Swamp Rice, estimated emission reductions are 124.1 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2020, 397.7 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2025 and 2030. For the promotion of efficiency in rice production, estimated emission reductions are 437.8 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2020, 707.0 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2025 and 2030.</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\">Reductions in the Energy Sector</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\"><br /></span>The energy supply mix mainly consists of traditional biomass and petroleum products, with biomass accounting for the vast majority. Petroleum products play an important role in the country‟s energy supply since it is the main source of fuel for transport and electricity generation, notwithstanding its negative environment consequences. In 2010, Total Energy Supply (TES) in The Gambia was 407,926 tons of oil equivalents (toe) according to UNIDO figures. As shown in Figure below, five conditional mitigation options have been identified and analyzed under the Energy Sector. Combined emissions reductions are 425.7 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2020, 541.1 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2025 and 629.6 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2030. Figure 5 and Table 1 to the right show the emission reductions per mitigation option.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\"><br /></span></p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Emission Reductions under Transport Systems</span><br />Of the total CO<sub>2</sub> (437.575 Gg) emitted from the Energy Sector in 2010 the Transport sub-sector accounted for 46% (MoE/TNC, 2015). Only one conditional mitigation option was analyzed under the Transport Sector. As shown in Figure 6, deployment of energy efficient vehicles will produce greenhouse gas emission reductions of 40.8 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2020, 114.5 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2025 and 193.3 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2030.</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Emission Reductions under Waste Management</span><br />Inadequate waste data is a major issue, regarding both GHG emissions and waste production, for both solid waste and wastewater. Current municipal solid waste generation in The Gambia amounts to approximately 438 tons/day and is expected to reach 1,295 tons/day in 2025 (World Bank 2012). Waste management is a major concern for Gambian Authorities, given that roughly 90% of waste is currently disposed in open dumps (e.g. Bakoteh Dump Site). This leads to severe environmental consequences (Sanneh et al. 2011), which can be exacerbated by the expected growth in waste generation volume in the future. Enhancement of the waste collection system is hindered by lack of vehicles. Specialized vehicles are too expensive to buy and maintain for the municipalities who are responsible for waste management. Over 40% of the population lives in the Greater Banjul Area (GBA). As such, the Government included in its NAMA agreed list the implementation of an Integrated Management initiative for solid and liquid waste in the GBA, which is expected to reduce emissions significantly but is also associated with an estimated implementation cost of USD 68 million.</p> <p>Under waste management, combined greenhouse gas emission reductions of 141 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2020, 239.7 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2025, and 413.7 GgCO<sub>2</sub>e&nbsp;in 2030 will be achieved through conditional methane capture, and waste recycling and composting.

First time period covers the years 2000-2015. The year 2000 is used because it is the year that most recent inventory data obtained using the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is available (second national communications). Second and third time- periods are from 2016 to 2020 and 2021-2030 respectively.</p> <p>3.1. Scenario 1: Economic diversification with a robust contribution from oil and its derivatives export revenues. Export revenues channelled into investments in high valueadded sectors such as financial services, medical services, tourism, education, renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to enhance economic growth. Ambitions outlined in this INDC are set under this scenario.</p> <p>3.2. Scenario 2: Accelerated domestic industrialization based on sustainable utilization of oil and gas. A heavy industrial base built to use domestic oil resources asfeedstock or energy source. Increasing contributions of petrochemical, cement, mining and metal production industries to the national economy. Economic growth will be much slower under this scenario, and will be difficult for the Kingdom to finance its INDC ambitions with domestic resources. In this case, this INDC will be adjusted to account for this scenario.</p> <p>3.3. The main difference between the two baseline scenarios is the allocation of oil produced for either domestic consumption or export. While exported oil will not contribute to the GHG emissions of Saudi Arabia, the domestic consumption will increase its GHG emissions. For the ex-ante estimations, the baseline is determined based on differently weighted combinations of the two scenarios.

          "value": "<p>\"Currently, Sudan has neither an overall baseline emission scenario for all sources of emissions and removals in the three sectors covered in this contribution, nor sectoral baselines that can be used to define quantitative mitigation actions and assess their overall effects. As such, Sudan is planning to establish a baseline as part of its proposal for a low-carbon development strategy, of which its preparation is still pending availability of financial and technical support. Sudan is currently embarking on the implementation of its Readiness Preparation Proposal for REDD+, which will also enable Sudan to establish reference emissions levels / forest reference levels (ERL/FRL) for the forestry sector. For the implementation of the intended contribution included in this INDC, Sudan foresees that sectoral or project level specific baselines should be established to enable a robust assessment of the effect of these mitigation contributions.</p> <p>The trend in Sudan&rsquo;s total GHG emissions indicates an increase by about 8%; from 72,014 Gg of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) in 1995 to 77,650 Gg CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2000. In 2000, the total GHG emissions in the three sectors that are covered in Sudan&rsquo;s INDC are estimated at 8,539Gg from energy, 9,392 Gg from LUCF1 and 2,015 Gg from waste. The major drivers for these changes in GHG emission levels are attributed to, among others, changes in emissions from the energy sector, which increased by roughly 10%, mainly due to increased fossil fuel consumption.</p> <p>Regarding the waste sector, emissions from waste management have more than doubled, mainly due to greater amounts of municipal solid waste sent to landfill sites. There are a number of limitations and shortcomings affecting the GHG estimations in the three sectors, mainly related to serious problems of data availability and quality, and partly related to technical capacity and application of methods.</p> <p>Energy consumption in Sudan is expected to reach over 13 million tons of oil-equivalent (TOE) by 2030. Diesel and gasoline, used primarily in the transport sector, dominate future growth in fossil fuels and account for over 70% of energy use by 2030. GHG emissions associated with this energy use trajectory are expected to reach just over 24 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent by 2030, a 6-fold increase from year 2000 levels (see Figure 4-2). The transport and electricity sectors together account for most of the growth in GHG emissions in Sudan, with these two sectors responsible for around 70% of projected GHG emissions by 2030 (SNC 2013). The current source of electrical power in Sudan is a mix of hydropower and thermal power generation plants. The thermal power generation is composed of steam turbines, diesel engine, and steam turbines which have lower-efficiency of about 14% compared with gas high efficiency diesel-fired combined cycle unit up to 45 %. Therefore, there is a need to shift to the high efficiency diesel- fired combined cycle unit but the initial cost is high, predominantly due to the lack of available infrastructure for LNG importation and as well as the necessary high and long-term investments.</p> <p>Sustainable land use management faces great challenges in Sudan mainly due to poor policy coordination across sectors (i.e., forestry, agriculture, range and protected lands). Additional factors include the absence of unified legislation, absence of high-resolution land use maps, inadequate consideration of the socio-economic factors, and weak implementation of the existing legislation and policies by the sectors. This land use context has led to serious environmental problems such as overgrazing, over cultivation and reduced land productivity which in turn have led to rural poverty, and rural-urban migration patterns that cannot be sustained in the long-term. In the absence of concerted efforts to address these issues, land degradation is expected to worsen over the next 30 years. Factors such as unsustainable wood fuel use, increasing demand for agriculture and grazing resources, and mismanaged of forests and land use has led to the current deforestation rate, which is estimated at 2.2 of the total land area.\"</p>"

The estimated global warming of 2&deg;C would imply for Angola severe economic losses for Agriculture sector, a sector that contributes to over 8% of the country GDP and at threat to the stability of food security. The Government of Angola has been diverting own funds to carry out implementation of complementary initiatives addressing these Climate Change impacts.</p> <p>In addition, Angola is the third-largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa and a net exporter of fossil fuels, and by now the second largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria. According to the country‟s Initial National Communication (INC) report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) released in 2012 (but based on emission inventory statistics from 2005) Angola only contributed approximately with 66.8 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e of Greenhouse Gas Emissions to the atmosphere. This contribution is meagre and represents a small percentage of current global GHG emissions. However, though showing an insignificant contribution, at 0.1% of the total global emissions, while the per-capita emissions are 4.15 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2005<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> compared to the global average<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[2]</a>.Angola recognises that in order to meet the 2 degree objective all countries will need to undertake mitigation measures. In fact the Government of Angola has enacted a considerable amount of Laws and Policies as well has developed important sectoral studies which gives an idea of how determined the Government Authorities are to take the country to the forefront of African countries reducing their GHG emissions.Angola‟s approach focuses on avoiding an increase of emissions per capita beyond the current level, while pursuing its development goals.Through this INDC Angola is determined to reduce its emissions trajectory by nearly 50% below the BAU scenario by 2030. In selecting the actions outlined above, Angola has prioritised those which fit with the growth priorities set out in its national development plans in particular the Angola 2025 Policy Document. In addition, Angola has captured the synergies between mitigation and adaptation, not only by prioritising those adaptation activities with significant mitigation co-benefits but also by seeking to minimise the carbon footprint of its adaptation portfolio as a whole. Angola is therefore putting forward Mitigation actions as well as Adaptation measures with mitigation benefits amounting over 15,7 billion USD that align with a low carbon development pathway, which to be fully implemented would require additional international support in the form of finance, technology transfer and capacity building.\"</p> <p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;Ministry of Environment.Angola Initial National Communication.(2011) Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).194 p.&nbsp;<br /><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\">[2]</a>&nbsp;GHG time series 1990-2012 per capita emissions for world countries http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/overview.php?v=GHGts_pc1990- 2012</p>"

Its emissions are therefore insignificant compared to global emissions. Despite its negligible responsibility for global warming and its LDC status, Benin has adopted a climate change management program that includes actions for all fields of climate change management. Through the implementation of its contribution, Benin will strengthen its carbon sequestration potential by its national forest cover, while its cumulative emissions from now till 2030 will decline compared to the reference year. An effort is underway to fight against air pollution by improving traffic flow (construction of specific structures for major intersections, bicycle lanes and pedestrian paths development) especially in the city of Cotonou, the tax and customs exemption on 4T motorcycles and motorcycle parts to the detriment of 2T motorcycles, the rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing rail network for public transport development, despite the pressure exerted by these measures on its budget.

Current generations are bearing the costs of past interference with the global climate system, resulting from human activities and consequent greenhouse gas emissions, primarily by developed countries, during the last two centuries. Similarly, current human activities around the world will affect the climate system over the next centuries.</p> <p>In order to build a fair and equitable global response to climate change, it is therefore of central importance to link cause (net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions) and effect (temperature increase and global climate change).</p> <p>The global mean surface temperature increase due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is an objective criterion to measure climate change, serving the purpose of establishing upper limits to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p> <p>The specific and relative role of each actor's emissions to global climate change can be determined using the global mean surface temperature as an indicator. Each individual actor's contribution to temperature increase should take into consideration differences in terms of starting points, approaches, economic structures, resource bases, the need to maintain sustainable economic growth, available technologies and other individual circumstances.</p> <p>Establishing the series, in all sectors, of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks allows the estimation of the relative share of total temperature increase attributable to an individual country. The relative responsibility of a given country in relation to the global mean surface temperature increase can be estimated with a high level of confidence. Hence, the marginal relative contribution to the global average surface temperature increase is a relevant measure to evaluate responsibility in the global effort to limit temperature increase to 2&deg;C compared to preindustrial levels.</p> <p>Brazil's mitigation efforts are of a type, scope and scale at least equivalent to the iNDCs of those developed countries most responsible for climate change. In view of the above, and based on available tools, it is evident that Brazil's iNDC, while consistent with its national circumstances and capabilities, is far more ambitious than what would correspond to Brazil's marginal relative responsibility for the global average temperature increase.\"</p>"

However, Colombia is a developing country that has important social, economic and environmental challenges ahead, as mentioned below. Among these challenges it is worth mentioning that the country is highly vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>Considering both the capabilities and the development challenges that the country faces, Colombia proposes an iNDC that is ambitious and equitable.</p><p><strong>Building Peace</strong></p><p>Building peace in Colombia presents economic, social and environmental challenges for the country. Some of these challenges can be addressed through actions that at the same time have a potential to contribute to mitigation and adaptation to climate change. In the past, peace processes elsewhere in the world have been associated to negative impacts on the environment, due to, among other things, migration patterns that increase pressure on natural resources in the most vulnerable areas, often resulting in increased deforestation. These potential impacts have been taken into account in post-conflict scenarios in different regions.</p><p>Adaptation measures aiming at planning a rational use of ecosystem services that have been prioritized, such as water resources, allow for a better management and use of those resources and ensure the dynamics of supply and demand in the country. To include a climate change component in territories and sectors planning instruments, increases the adaptation capacity of the country, and in addition, contributes to increased resilience in face of events that may affect national development objectives.</p><p>Thus, mitigation and adaptation to climate change have the potential to facilitate the consolidation of peace territories where productive activities and land uses can, in a more equitable manner and with greater ownership of the territory, play a key role providing better development opportunities, in particular in rural communities.</p><p><strong>Overcoming Poverty</strong></p><p>Colombia, as a developing country, faces major socioeconomic challenges. According to the official figures of DANE, by 2014, the percentage of people in multidimensional poverty situation was 21.9% (this figure rises to 44.1% if we take into account only the rural population). For the same year, 28.5% of the population was found in a situation of monetary poverty (41.4% of the population in the case of the villages and rural centers scattered). It is clear that despite its progress, Colombia still faces major challenges in terms of overcoming poverty and inequality.</p><p>Structuring a resilient and low-carbon economy is aligned with national development priorities including overcoming poverty in all its dimensions. Therefore, the country, as it has been doing in recent years, intends to actively participate in an ambitious and equitable way in the global efforts under the UNFCCC, taking into account the recommendations of the IPCC&acute;s Fifth Assessment Report.</p><p><strong>Towards a Resilient Development</strong></p><p>According to the National Unit for Disasters Risk Management, from 1998 to 2012, 90% of emergencies in Colombia were related to hydro-climatological phenomenon. Therefore, it is a priority to articulate the mitigation processes and efforts to be performed, including through the identification of potential cobenefits and synergies with adaptation, in order to move towards resilient and sustainable climate scenarios. Mitigation actions reduce the risk of loss and damage as well as future adaptation costs; while adaptation measures have co-benefits in reducing emissions.</p><p>Colombia assumes its iNDC as an opportunity to strengthen and build on the work done in the sectors and territories both in mitigation and adaptation to climate change. This will contribute to formulate policies, programs, plans and projects in an articulated way between the different productive sectors, public and private entities, non-governmental organizations and civil society in general.\"</p>"

To fight effectively against poverty, the country is committed to a sustainable development objective by signing the manifesto of Istandra. With the majority of the population living in coastal areas, actions of fighting poverty have focused on the protection of coastal areas, risk management etc. whose main effects will reduce vulnerability.</p> <p>From being a GHG sink in 2000, the Union of the Comoros became a GHG emitter in 2015 according to the baseline projections and on the basis of the inventories of 2000, 2005 and 2010. In 2010, Comoros&rsquo; emissions accounted for a tiny proportion of global emissions of greenhouse gases of 0.00045%. The country has increased its efforts over the past decade for sustainable growth and green, climate resilient and low-carbon development on the political and institutional levels alike. Thus actions against climate change (CC) in terms of mitigation and adaptation have been carried out since the 90&rsquo;s. Moreover, by the actions implemented to date, GHG emissions per capita have been contained at 0.4 tonne during the period between 2000 and 2010.

If Ethiopia&rsquo;s contribution is fully implemented, it would reduce per capita emissions to 1.1 tCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2030. For a Least Developed Country, this reduction exceeds expectations for both fairness and ambition while contributing towards the achievement of the objective of the Convention.</p> <p>Ethiopia has already removed fossil fuel subsidies to enable enhanced generation and use of clean and renewable energy. 76.7% of Ethiopia&rsquo;s population currently lacks access to modern energy sources, relying on wood for fuel. By continuing to prioritise renewable energy under the CRGE, Ethiopia will be able to increase energy access in rural areas. In this context, substantial investments are already being made, including the construction and operationalization of the Ethiopian Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD), amounting to USD 4 Billion generated from domestic sources.</p> <p>Ethiopia&rsquo;s greatest emission reduction potential is in the agriculture and forestry sectors, constituting 85% of emissions in 2010. Therefore, one of the priority initiatives under the CRGE is the use of more efficient stoves, amounting to an emissions reduction rate of 50 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e per year by 2030. Furthermore, Ethiopia intends to increase its ambition by expanding its forest cover, beyond the initial target for the afforestation and reforestation of 7 Million Hectares, with continued involvement from local communities that are already contributing substantially to the attainment of this target. By prioritising initiatives such as these, Ethiopia is maximising its mitigation potential and contributing towards the achievement of the objective of the Convention, whilst simultaneously supporting its sustainable development goals.</p> <p>An important component of Ethiopia&rsquo;s contribution includes actions to build resilience and enhance adaptation to the impacts of climate change. Given that 80% of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, increasing the resilience of agriculture is a priority for Ethiopia. This includes addressing the high levels of vulnerability of the sector to droughts and floods.</p> <p>Ethiopia also seeks to maximise the synergies between adaptation and mitigation, especially involving agriculture and forests. Many of the measures involving forestry and agriculture can provide substantial economic and livelihood benefits. By targeting actions in these sectors, Ethiopia is seizing the opportunities that ambitious climate action brings, helping to reduce both its future emissions and its vulnerability to climate impacts.</p> <p>Ethiopia recognises the negative impact of climate change on health, economic growth and natural resource conservation and that is why it has committed to undertake such ambitious action using its domestic resources. However, there are enormous untapped opportunities for increased action on climate change, including both mitigation and adaptation, in Ethiopia. For more than 80% of the abatement potential, abatement costs are less than USD 15 per ton CO<sub>2</sub>e.

The transfer of appropriate technologies and provision of adequate finance will have to be a determined contribution of the developed countries, which will further enable the developing countries to accomplish and even enhance their efforts. It is expected that developed countries would recognize that without means of implementation and adequate resources, the global vision is but a vacant dream. Addressing the United Nations Summit for the adoption of Post-2015 Development Agenda in September 2015, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi said; &ldquo;We should forge a global public partnership to harness technology, innovation and finance to put affordable clean and renewable energy within the reach of all.

The Country&rsquo;s bulk share of GHGs represents only around 0.06% of global total according to a global GHGs analysis conducted in 2010. According to the World Bank, the CO<sub>2</sub> metric tons per capita emission is 3.4 in 2010 as said before. Nevertheless, this small share of GHG did not justify a reluctant reaction of the Country. To the contrary, Jordan, historically, was amongst the most active countries in the region with regard to involvement in international climate change efforts and engagement in response actions as explained above. Most importantly, Jordan has voluntarily developed a national climate change policy in 2013, the first comprehensive policy in the Arab Region and the Middle East. In fact, Jordan willingly developed the National Climate Change Policy for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan 2013-2020. This policy is considered the first national-level comprehensive planning initiative to deal with the global phenomenon of climate change in a holistic approach in the Country. However, Jordan, as any of non-Annex I countries, has, so far, no commitments for GHG emission reduction targets. Nevertheless, Jordan believes that there is a large potential for mitigation, even though Jordan&rsquo;s total GHG emissions are very small in absolute terms, and compared to other countries as indicated above.</p><p>From another angle, the modest income levels of the Country along with development challenges described above, mainly poverty and unemployment as two of the most important challenges the Country faces as well as limitation in natural resources and energy challenges along with the demographic characteristics of the Jordanian population all show that the Jordanian development process faces a big challenge in providing basic needs in such a developing country. Moreover, the rapid growths in economic activities, population and successive influxes of refugees over the last decade have imposed additional demands on energy resources. While Jordan has achieved many sustainable development goals, sustaining these results and reducing the burden of the energy sector on economic and social development will increasingly depend on the transition to a sustainable energy future.

In this context, it is worth mentioning that within 1990-2014 period, the Real GDP decreased in the Republic of Moldova by 29 per cent, from 9.8935 to 6.9881 billion 2010 US$, while the real GDP per capita decreased by 14 per cent, from 2,261.9 to 1,950.2 2010 US$.</li><li>The mitigation potential and abatement costs are other core aspects in considering a fair contribution of a country.

These values are still among the highest within the transition economies from the Central and Eastern Europe and reveal a high mitigation potential to achieve the Republic of Moldova's reduction targets. But, in order to reach the conditional target of up to 78 per cent reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, appropriate international financial support approximately equal to US$ 4.9-5.1 billion, i.e. about US$ 327-340 million per year until 2030, is needed; the support needed will be in addition to the domestic allocations to cover the required abatement costs. This support will allow adjusting the development pathway of the Republic of Moldova towards a low-carbon economy, thus moving towards progressive decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth and ensuring a decent level of Real GDP per capita, equal to 4,483 US$/capita in 2030, which will still be approximately one-tenth of EU 28 average, forecasted to be US$ 43,516/capita in 2030.

In addition, financial resources are also frequently reallocated to address losses due to increased incidences of natural disasters.</p><ul> <li>Malaysia has taken early action</li> </ul> <p>Since the Ninth Malaysia Plan (2006-2010), Malaysia has started initiatives to increase the share of use of non-fossil fuel energy. The National Biofuel Policy 2006 already laid the groundwork for the development and use of biofuels. The National Biofuel Industry Act 2007 was put in place to regulate the biofuel industry and to promote the mandatory use of the B5 domestic blend of 5% palm biodiesel and 95% fossil fuel diesel. At the end of 2014, Malaysia had also introduced the bio-diesel B7 Programme.</p> <p>The Tenth Malaysia Plan (2011-2015) focussed on sustainable growth and introducing mitigation strategies to reduce emissions of GHG. Three significant financial stools were introduced to promote sustainability measures. These consist of the introduction of a feedin-tariff (FiT) mechanism in conjunction with the Renewable Energy Policy and Action Plan (2010) to help finance renewable energy investment, providing fiscal incentives and funding for green technology investments and promoting projects eligible for carbon credits. In the forestry sector, two major initiatives were launched, the Central Forest Spine (CFS) and Heart of Borneo (HOB) to ensure sustainable forest management and use of natural resources.</p> <p>The government will continue to pursue the green growth goal under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (2016-2020) will further focus on pursuing green growth for sustainability and resilience. These include strengthening enabling environment for green growth, adoption of sustainable consumption and production, conserving natural resources and strengthening resilience against climate change and natural disasters. These actions will further reduce Malaysia&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p> <ul> <li>Major barriers for implementation include high costs and capacity constraints</li> </ul> <p>Malaysia developed A Roadmap of Emissions Intensity Reduction in Malaysia in 2014.

However, while these opportunities exist, considerable efforts would be required to realise these emissions reductions in light of the challenges and barriers described below.</p> <p>TECHNOLOGY COST</p> <p>Many mitigation actions are limited by the cost and suitability of appropriate technologies. Generation cost of renewable energy is still higher than conventional energies while rail based mass transport systems have high capital cost. Benefit relating to electrification of transportation systems are also limited by the current fuel mix used for electricity generation which consist mainly of fossil fuels.</p> <p>INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK and CAPACITY</p> <p>Climate change is a cross cutting issue and currently the institutional framework to address the issue is fragmented. It is often a consequential co-benefit outcome of agencies&rsquo; core responsibilities.

However, there are some areas of forest that have been degraded due to past management effects. Restoration and rehabilitation of these forests incurs high cost and nurturing. Furthermore, the advent of climate change has also highlighted another legacy in forest management, that is, the drained peatlands. In the 1960s and 70s, peatlands were considered a wasteland and draining was considered an effective rehabilitation to improve the productivity.

In 2012, per capita GHG emissions is at 5.63 tCO<sub>2</sub>e and emissions per GDP (US$ million) is 409.54 tCO<sub>2</sub>e, which is lower than world average. In terms of emission profile, the Second National Communication indicates that 67% of total GHG emissions in Thailand in 2000 is from the energy sector. In 2012, CAIT data indicates 73% share is from energy. Consequently, Thailand's mitigation efforts have focused primarily on the energy, including transport sector.</p> <p>At COP20 in Lima, Thailand pledged our pre-2020 contribution of 7-20% GHG emission reduction by 2020 below business-as-usual (BAU) in the energy and transport sectors. According to a preliminary analysis, Thailand has already achieved 4% of GHG emission reduction from the projected 2020 BAU and is well on track to achieving the 7% target pledged as voluntary domestic efforts by 2020. Our INDC will continue such efforts with ambitious plans in the relevant sectors while considering also our national circumstances and context, including:</p> <p><strong>Thailand has taken early actions in the field of energy and has very ambitious plans in the relevant sectors.</strong></p> <p>Energy security has long been an issue of concern over the course of Thailand's development. In the past, power generation in Thailand relied heavily on crude oil imports. To remedy this, the Government initiated a shift to natural gas in the power generation sector as early as the 1980s. Such effort has continued throughout the 1990s. And, in 2005 about 72% of electricity in Thailand was generated using natural gas, which is already a cleaner alternative to other types of fossil fuels. These early actions imply that Thailand is left with less available choices and faced with higher marginal cost of further reducing GHG emission in the energy sector.</p> <p>Despite some limitations due to our early actions, the Ministry of Energy is taking a step forward to balance three key aspects of energy planning for Thailand: security, economy and ecology, also taking into account the need to address climate change. Ambitious targets are defined in the Power Development Plan (PDP), the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) and the Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP). For example, the PDP sets a target to achieve a 20% share of power generation from renewable sources in 2036. The AEDP aims to achieve a 30% share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption in 2036. The EEP plans to reduce the country&rsquo;s energy intensity by 30% below the 2010 level in 2036.</p> <p>The Environmentally Sustainable Transport System Plan also proposes ambitious actions to promote road-to-rail modal shift for both freight and passenger transport, which include extensions of mass rapid transit lines, construction of double-track railways and improvement of bus transit in the Bangkok Metro areas. A vehicle tax scheme based on CO<sub>2</sub> emission was also approved and will become effective beginning 2016. In addition, just last year the Government adopted the Waste Management Roadmap, aiming towards more efficient and sustainable waste management and promotion of power generation from waste-to-energy technologies. The roadmap can contribute tremendous environmental benefits in terms of GHG emission and pollution reduction. Currently, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is also studying the potential to reduce carbon emission in the forest sector through the REDD+ Readiness. We will continue to explore further opportunities and cooperation in this sector.</p> <p><strong>Major barriers to successful implementation include high costs and capacity constraints.</strong></p> <p>It is important to incorporate concerns that several of the proposed measures and actions in these ambitious plans are subject to very high investment and operating costs, particularly costs of technologies and infrastructures which can become an important barrier to successful implementation of the plans. Some of the key barriers for the energy sector include, for instance, limitation of grid connection due to inadequate capacity of transmission lines, lack of support by financial institutions for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments, lack of domestic technological and technical resources and negative public perception particularly against waste-to-energy and biomass power plants. Several measures require a high level of technical capacity and effective coordination across different sectoral agencies, whereas such technical capacity and effective coordination in a developing country like Thailand is currently lacking. For renewable energy development in particular, the International Energy Agency also cited some of the above-mentioned barriers as common barriers for renewable energy deployment in developing countries. Domestically, Thailand has launched several support mechanisms such as feed-in tariffs, tax incentives and access to investment grants and venture capital to promote renewable energy. However, to achieve ambitious and more rapid renewable energy deployment, incentives have to be created for technology developers to cooperate and&nbsp;share technology knowledge to enable technology transfer on a larger scale. International financial support mechanisms such as technical assistance and technology transfer funds for purchasing intellectual property rights for a free distribution of clean energy technologies would be very valuable to accelerate diffusion of renewable energy technologies for developing countries. Furthermore, efforts are needed to inform the public, through lessons-learned and experience sharing from other countries, as well as showcasing success stories from pilot or demonstration projects, for instance. It is therefore crucial that international cooperation through the UNFCCC focus on these cooperative attempts to unlock the potentials of developing countries in their contributions towards the global solutions to climate change by addressing these important identified barriers, making technological solutions more affordable for developing countries and strengthening the capacity of developing countries to implement these solutions more effectively and more sustainably. Successful implementation of these ambitious mitigation plans in Thailand, in addition to our domestic efforts, will be subject to adequate and predictable access to enhanced means of implementation agreed under the UNFCCC.\"</p>"

Since 1991, at the initial stage of the period of state independence, and especially during the period 1992-2000, the Republic of Tajikistan had experienced grave consequences resulting from civil war and of the transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy, with a sharp increase in poverty. During the period 2008-2015, the socio-economic indicators of the Republic of Tajikistan have improved. For the Republic of Tajikistan, the basic priority of climate measures lies in adaptation because of high dependence of the considerable part of the population and of the branches of the economy on climatic conditions, also taking into account the key role of the country’s mountain ecosystems in water resources generation and biological diversity for Central Asia. The existing assessed contribution of the Republic of Tajikistan to global greenhouse gas emissions is less than 0.02%. In view of a low level of greenhouse gas emissions and a very high share of hydro-power (more than 90%), the level of greenhouse gas emissions of the Republic of Tajikistan will amount to 80-90% by 2030, as compared to 1990 (as stated in the INDC); this will ensure the achievement of socially acceptable and scientifically grounded indicators, both in absolute and per capita terms. By doing so, the Republic of Tajikistan adheres to the basic principle of the UNFCCC – common but differentiated responsibility – and expects an adequate level of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from economically developed countries and the largest countries-emitters of greenhouse gases in accordance with the IPCC scientific recommendations to prevent global warming of more than 2 degrees Сelsius. The international support of the intentions of the Republic of Tajikistan with respect to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and a full-scale implementation of climate adaptation and resilience measures will enable the country to be strongly on track to green economy and climate-resilient development. The forests and gardens in Tajikistan are of critical importance for the preservation of mountain ecosystems and biodiversity, improvement of the state of lands and prevention of their further degradation, protection of vulnerable infrastructure, protection of water resources and carbon absorption from the atmosphere. That is why they play a specific role both in terms of mitigating the impact of anthropogenic activity on the climate and reducing negative consequences.\"</p>"

It prioritises specific measures in energy supply, forestry and wetlands to provide both Greenhouse Gas emission reductions as well as development benefits. As of 2011, only 15% of Uganda&rsquo;s population had access to electricity. By committing to increase Uganda&rsquo;s renewable energy generation capacity by 2030 and prioritising the construction of enabling infrastructure for the electricity sector, Uganda is not only reducing its emissions by approximately 3.2 Million tons Carbon dioxide equivalent per year , but also enabling greater access to reliable and sustainable energy for the 85% of Uganda&rsquo;s population that live in rural areas, in turn, improving the livelihoods and health of rural populations.</p> <p>Uganda&rsquo;s greatest mitigation potential is in the land use, land-use change and forestry sectors. Reversing the current deforestation trend (of approximately 14% in 2013) to increase forest cover to 21% in 2030 is highly ambitious considering that 89.5% of the country&rsquo;s energy needs are currently met by charcoal and firewood.

By structuring its contribution in this way, Uganda is able to contribute to the global efforts to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions and contribute to the achievement of the objective of the Convention, while at the same time addressing domestic development needs and priorities.</p> <p>Despite the ambition of Uganda&rsquo;s proposed contribution, additional assistance would enable Uganda to increase its resilience and realise greater Greenhouse Gas emissions reductions.

In this Hybrid Conditional Scenario, Burkina Faso moves toward sustainable development. And the Integrated Adaptation Scenario lends itself well to transforming the resource consumption economy of Burkina Faso into a gradually green (or almost green) economy and into a society with low carbon emissions. In this scenario, it is estimated that the total value of the environmental services provided by the actions that are proposed in the AFOLU sectors over the 15 years up to 2030 would be at least US $11,500,000,000, which would give a return on investment of more than 400% (which, when compared with the solely financial return of primary production of 64%, is six times greater).

          "value": "<p>The information on fairness and ambition was communicated in a combined section in the INDC and was separated based on the content.</p><p>\"This target is ambitious but achievable. It represents a substantial reduction from Canada&rsquo;s business-as-usual emissions. Canada has already undertaken decisive actions domestically to reduce our emissions, and is committed to doing more in concert with all major emitters. Reaching this ambitious target will require new policies in additional sectors and coordinated continental action in integrated sectors. Canada may also use international mechanisms to achieve the target, subject to robust systems that deliver real and verified emissions reductions.</p> <p>Canada is making progress in reducing our emissions &ndash; from 2005 to 2013, Canadian greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 3.1% while the economy grew by 12.9%. The Government of Canada is implementing a responsible sector-by-sector regulatory approach to reduce emissions, aligned with Canada&rsquo;s major economic partners, like the United States, recognizing the importance of cooperative action in an integrated North American marketplace. Through this approach Canada has already taken steps to reduce emissions from two of the largest emitting sectors of the Canadian economy &ndash; transportation and electricity.</p><p>Building on the strong base of clean electricity generation, Canada has established stringent coal-fired electricity standards that ban the construction of traditional coal-fired electricity generation units, and will accelerate the phase-out of existing coal-fired electricity generation units. Canada has also taken action in the transportation sector, which is responsible for approximately 25% of Canada&rsquo;s emissions, by working closely with the United States towards common North American greenhouse gas standards for vehicles. The Government of Canada has put in place progressively more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards for passenger automobiles and light trucks as well as regulations for heavy-duty vehicles. As a result of these regulations, greenhouse gas emissions from new passenger vehicles, light trucks and heavy-duty vehicles are steadily declining. For example, 2025 model year passenger vehicles and light trucks will emit about half as many greenhouse gases as 2008 models.</p> <p>Canada is continuing to develop and implement measures to reduce emissions from other key greenhouse gas sources. For example, in December 2014 the Government of Canada announced our intent to regulate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), the fastest growing greenhouse gases globally. Canada intends to develop regulations to address methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas fired electricity, chemicals and nitrogen fertilizers through our responsible sector-by-sector regulatory approach that ensures Canada&rsquo;s economic competitiveness is protected. Canada will continue to take cooperative action with our continental trading partners, particularly the United States, and will work towards further action in integrated sectors of the economy, including energy and transportation.</p><p>Canada&rsquo;s regulatory approach is coupled with significant investments in clean energy technologies in order to drive a steady transition to a low carbon economy. Since 2006, the Government of Canada has invested more than $10 billion in green infrastructure, energy efficiency, clean energy technologies, cleaner fuels and smarter grids. Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Investments towards the development and demonstration of clean technology products such as electrical vehicle charging stations and wind hybrid power plants.</li> <li>Investments to encourage the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind, low-impact hydro, biomass, photovoltaic and geothermal energy.</li> </ul> <p>Canada is a leader in clean energy technologies, and has made multiple investments in such technologies to promote further innovation. Examples include the world&rsquo;s first large scale power sector carbon capture and storage project in Saskatchewan, as well as the first carbon capture and storage project at an oil sands operation. As a result, Canada is making meaningful progress to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in key sectors. For example, emerging technologies and federal regulatory action has limited emissions in the transportation sector, despite growth in vehicle fleets while emissions are falling in the electricity sector due to coal phase out, switching to natural gas and growth in non-emitting generation. To build on this success, Canada will focus climate-related investments in innovative production technologies to continue to drive further improvements in environmental performance in the oil sands and other growing sectors.</p> <p>In Canada, climate change is a shared responsibility that requires action from all levels of government. Canadian provinces and territories have jurisdictional authorities over the fields of natural resources, energy, and many aspects of the environment. Each has its own legal framework, policies and measures in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment, a federal/provincial/territorial intergovernmental forum, has agreed that climate change will be on its agenda on an ongoing basis.\"</p>"

It also represents a significant reduction from BAU emissions and continuing improvement in the emissions efficiency of the New Zealand economy.

With its semi-arid nature and climate conditions that are still more uncertain in the years to come, this transformation will demand considerable efforts and huge investments in adaptation, particularly in the agriculture-forests-land use (AFOLU) sectors. The adaptation solutions exist to help the population foresee and prepare to face the effects of climate change that will inevitably arise because of the GHG emissions that have already taken place since 1900.\"</p>"

This action will be complemented by the continuation of climate change mitigation/adaptation mainstreaming into the National Plans and Policies as well as the implementation of the National Strategy for the Implementation of UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. This framework comprises: generating reports and inventories about GHG emissions in&nbsp;Angola and their impact on the environment and public health; producing programmes and projects with measures to mitigate climate change; developing technical and professional training actions in areas related to climate change; fostering international co-operation within the context of climate change, particularly in terms of transfer of knowledge, experience and technology.

Some of this amount has already been provided by the Government of Angola within the Unconditional Mitigation and Adaptation scenario.

By undertaking&nbsp;these actions Angola will achieve the potential conditional target of 50 % emissions reduction below BAU emission levels by 2030. For this, the Government of Angola will pursue international support to utilize existing and emerging climate finance mechanisms and will encourage investments in green growth development initiatives. These projects are briefly described below and several of them are already on the agenda or subjected to feasibility assessments.</p> <p>The total funds required for the implementation of these projects are roughly about 14.7billion USD to reach the mitigation target.</p> <p>See Angola's full INDC submission for additional information on projects in the power sector, and \"The use of biomass as energy source\", \"The agriculture sector\", and \"The Forest Carbon Options\", etc.</p>"

Based on lessons learned and best practices from other SIDS such as Palau and the British Virgin Islands, the Government will investigate the viability of, amongst other measures: (i) setting aside the valued added tax (VAT) charged for fuel; (ii) charging carbon levies to offset greenhouse gas emissions for international air transport to the country; and (iii) charging fees for climate change research undertaken in the country. Such fees and charges will be used to establish and finance a climate change trust fund for priority climate change measures.</p> <p>Additionally, the Government of Kiribati intends to build national capacity to facilitate direct access to international climate change financing including the Green Climate Fund so as to ensure that financing for climate resilience is country-owned and directed towards priority national needs and community-based adaptation plans.

Collecting, analyzing and applying hydro-meteorological and climate data for decision-making and dissemination of early warnings.\"</p> <p>Summary of Needs</p> <p>\"As a post-conflict country, it is imperative for South Sudan to ensure sustainable and climate-resilient development across all sectors. South Sudan is one of the least developed countries of the world and the development policies have to go hand in hand with the climate change initiatives for a more resilient population. Therefore, it is imperative to consolidate platforms for the exchange of knowledge and information related to mitigation and adaptation, as well as to strengthen networks with academic institutions and civil society. Furthermore, it is fundamental to incorporate a gender and human rights approach into capacity building, prioritizing the most vulnerable groups in order to reduce social inequality. Within the context of the current economic circumstances, low levels of capacity and limited availability of climate technologies, South Sudan will only be able to embark on achieving its INDCs with the financial, capacity building and technical support from the international community in its efforts at all levels. The implementation of the above mentioned mitigation and adaptation actions for the period 2016 &ndash; 2030 requires the continuous development and strengthening of South Sudan&rsquo;s capacities.</p> <p>Regarding climate finance, South Sudan has yet to access the same level of financial resources as other least developed countries owing to its recent existence. It is therefore of utmost importance that South Sudan is extended the opportunity to obtain support from the international donor community and other sources of climate finance to design and implement initiatives aimed at addressing the mitigation and adaptation priorities outlined here within the country&rsquo;s INDCs. South Sudan has begun the process of unlocking access to climate finance through the initiation of the NAPA process that is due to conclude in November 2015. South Sudan also aims to access finance through international carbon markets, and will pursue CDM and REDD+ activities, including the establishment is a Designated National Authority. Subsequent to this, it will require concerted and coordinated effort between the Government of South Sudan and their international development partners to accelerate the process of designing and implementing climate change projects to address both immediate and urgent priorities as well as medium- and long-term climate change risks.</p> <p>It is estimated that investment of over USD 50 billion is required for mitigation and adaptation actions across sectors up to 2030. These are approximate estimates and further analysis is planned to identify support requirements for implementing the policies and actions listed above. \"</p>"

Through this approach, and with adequate financial incentives and support, Suriname intends to maintain its high forest cover and low deforestation rate. As part of this approach, Suriname is keen to strengthen forest governance institutions and collaboration with the private sector and other stakeholders and to expand its program of awareness, monitoring and enforcement while also promoting research and a&nbsp;comprehensive forest inventory to provide detailed information on forests.</p> <p>Suriname is currently undertaking a process of REDD+ Readiness at the national level and initial steps are being taken to assess the drivers of deforestation and to develop strategy, approaches, and options among the key sectors including agriculture, logging, and mining. Also, estimation of national carbon stocks and the development of a Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) System are underway.</p> <p>A draft law for the protection of the mangrove forest along the North Atlantic coast of Suriname was prepared by the government. In addition, coastline stabilization by means of &lsquo;wave breakers&rsquo; to reduce wave force, promote sedimentation and subsequent mangrove regeneration, will increase mangrove forest stock and carbon sequestration.</p> <p>Considering that the tropical rainforests of the Republic of Suriname stores approximately 11 gigatons of carbon and absorbs more than 8.8 million tons of forest carbon annually, Suriname is keen to maintain its high forest cover and low deforestation rate if adequate incentives are provided over the long term. In this regard, applying carbon pricing and proxies from avoided deforestation models for similar ecosystems in rainforest countries, Suriname has estimated its mitigation contribution from carbon sequestration and avoided deforestation for the period up to 2025 at US$630 Million.\"</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Renewable energy</span></p> <p>\"Several renewable energy resources are technically feasible. Further studies are required to also explore the potentials of biofuels with rice husk, various grass species, and micro algae as the biological source. In consideration are a hydropower project with a potential output of 168MW; a biofuel project that could realize the introduction of ethanol in gasoline with 60% of vehicles utilizing the blend and at the same time produce 25MW of power; and 62MW from thermal energy. While Suriname has not yet been able to attribute costs to these major renewable energy initiatives, utilizing costs estimations from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), a 168MW hydropower project could cost between US$189Million and US$1.377Million. In addition, to aggressively pursue renewable energy, Suriname has already considered measures over short, medium and long-term, to upgrade efficiency. This would require&nbsp;financing estimated at approximately US$485 Million.</p> <p>Implementation of these conditional contributions to energy, is conservatively estimated at up to US$1.862Million (considering only hydropower and energy efficiency infrastructure). Through existing efforts and with funding for implementation, Suriname is keen to continue to transition its energy sector to ensure it stays above 25% renewable by 2025.\"</p> <p>Adaptation</p> <p>\"Further research and vulnerability assessments, infrastructure programs, and mainstreaming climate change in the social and productive sectors are critical actions to be taken in increasing resilience to climate change in the coastal zone as well as in the Interior. In addition, the introduction and implementation of various types of renewable energy requires, for instance, the installation of solar panel parks as well as micro-hydro power units in river systems; application of biomass-to-energy technology; installation of wind mills; and implementation of waste-to-energy technology. These, in turn, require human and institutional capacity building and financing. Financing is a key requirement to support these actions and determining in a comprehensive way the future costs of adaptation. Building climate resiliency is viewed as an immediate priority. Notwithstanding this, to be able to make minimum level adaptation interventions the Republic of Suriname requires an estimated US$1 Billion to support its climate resilience program of activities in the period up to 2025.\"</p><p><strong>Assumptions and Risks</strong></p> <p>\"A key assumption made in this INDC is that support from the&nbsp;international community, and in particular the ANNEX 1 countries, will be forthcoming in a timely manner in areas such as finance, technology transfer, renewable energy and training, and capacity building.</p> <p>It is also assumed that financial mechanisms under the UNFCCC including the Green Climate Fund will become fully operational and easily accessible for SIDS and low lying coastal countries.

While longer term impacts such as sea level rise could result in the unavoidable out-migration of some of her people, they have a right to pursue any and all means to ensure their nation survives and the legacy remains, with future generations living productive lives on these islands.</p> <p>Climate change is a cross-cutting development issue as it affects every aspect of the Tuvaluan way of life and livelihoods. Climate change impacts exacerbate existing cultural and socio-economic vulnerabilities. These impacts threaten the security of the nation. To this end, the people of Tuvalu must collectively build and strengthen the nation&rsquo;s resilience to combat climate change. However, this cannot be done alone and in isolation; regional and global cooperation is imperative to put Tuvalu on a pathway to climate change resilience and sustainable development.</p> <p>Tuvalu is of the view that the scientific underpinnings of the discussions on climate change are clear in defining impact thresholds. Therefore, international cooperation is required. Any failure to reach an agreement to radically cut emissions would jeopardize Tuvalu&rsquo;s development and survivability.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tuvalu continues to revise its policies in energy, climate change and the electricity sector in line with its sustainable development as contained in the National Strategic Development Plan. The significant costs of imported fossil fuels are a major factor in Tuvalu&rsquo;s balance of payments. Whilst Tuvalu continues to take actions to reduce its fossil fuel import bill, thereby reducing its carbon footprint, it will underscore the need for support to assist in its ambition for transforming the energy sector to non-carbon sources through greater use of renewables such as solar and wind and use of transformational technology.</p> <p>Tuvalu&rsquo;s INDC includes unconditional, conditional and aspirational contribution to reducing emissions. The unconditional contribution includes actions that Tuvalu has already undertaken through renewable energy programmes to reduce, significantly, its reliance on imported fossil fuels for electricity generation. It will continue to push, through other measures such as conservation, education and energy efficiency and other measures, recognizing its extreme vulnerability to the impacts of fossil fuel prices. These comprise approximately a quarter of the total imports, and any reduction in the energy bills would assist in diverting development funds to other priority areas such as poverty reduction.</p> <p>International support is crucial to enable Tuvalu implement further actions enshrined in its Policies and Plans, including at sectorial level. For example, the growing emissions in the transport sector, as evidenced from the increased numbers of vehicles on land and vessel for sea transport, needs to be addressed through technological innovations.

Therefore, it is important to note that this INDC document has drawn on available reports and studies while other national-wide and localityspecific vulnerabilities, and adaption needs have not been reflected owing to lack of sufficient information at this stage when the INDC is drafted.</p> <p>Additional ssupport will also needed on issues relating to Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) as well as Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EBA) including on sustainable management of natural resource, and disaster risk management (DRM) to help the country reduce potential loss and damages associated with climate induced disaster risk scenarios such as the already occurring extreme hydrological weather events including more frequent and severe droughts and floods.</p> <p>Consequently the implementation of Yemen&rsquo;s INDC will need significant support in terms of capacity building and technology development and transfer. Without such support under such a fragile situation, the looming environmental scarcity threats, and climate change impacts and potential risks will further compound the mounting political-security effects on the poor in general and the most vulnerable in particular.\"</p>"

It is estimated that over USD 50 billion is required for both mitigation (USD 35 billion for Domestic efforts with substantial International support) and adaptation (USD 20 billion) actions across the programs up to 2030. Of this, USD 15 billion will be unconditional support provided by the Zambian Government and USD 35 billion will be conditional support to be sourced externally. Zambia will require international support in form of finance, investment, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building to fully realize its intended contribution.

The various funding, technology and capacity mechanisms related to the Convention such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN), Adaptation Fund, Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and continued investment by developmental partners in the national climate change discourse will be critical. The enactment of a ‘favourable’ agreement in Paris, France in December 2015 will be an added advantage.\"</p><p>For adaptation, Zimbabwe communicates that \"the Zimbabwe Agriculture Investment Plan (2013-2018) indicates that the sector requires investments of at least US$2 billion per year to fully utilise its production potential. Currently the sector is relying on a US$0.5 billion allocation from the national treasury. Up to US$35 billion will be cumulatively needed by 2030 under Business As Usual (BAU) for adapting to climate change in the agriculture sector. Zimbabwe aims to achieve this through joint efforts between the government, private sector, development partners and technology and funding mechanisms foreseen in context of the UNFCCC. Based on the status of current budget provisions, the total domestic support through the national government needed to build resilience of the agricultural sector is estimated at US$8.725. The required international support for adapting the agricultural sector of Zimbabwe is estimated at US$26.175 billion by 2030 under BAU. Further collation and analysis of information on support for financial investment, capacity development and technology generation and transfer in adaptation initiatives is however required.\"</p><p>Zimbabwe further notes that \"a more comprehensive exercise such as the National Adaptation Planning (NAP) process will advance the assessment of the countries' vulnerability, adaptation needs and costs.\"</p>"

The minimum recorded temperature in Djibouti City has also increased by close to 1.3&deg;C in the last 30 years. Furthermore, the geographic location of the Republic of Djibouti renders it directly vulnerable to sea level rise since 88% of the Djiboutian population lives in coastal zones.</p> <p>These difficult conditions cause serious problems in water availability, in quantity and quality, whether for the human population, livestock or agriculture. &nbsp;The resources of the aquifer are no longer sufficient to provide for the many needs of the country.</p> <p>The Republic of Djibouti also possesses important terrestrial biodiversity (mangroves, the Day forest, and endemic species). However, it is threatened by a constant diminution of its arable lands and its biodiversity because of a rapid process of desertification which will get worse with rising temperatures. Likewise, regarding its marine ecosystems, more than half of its coral reefs have come to disappear during recent years.</p> <p>These degradations risk to profoundly affect local populations dependent on these resources which are already in poverty. The impacts linked to climate change create significant financial and human losses, primarily in the capital city but also in other regions. National priorities for adaptation have therefore been identified up until 2035 and are based on several strategies.

For instance, the protection of water basins will not only avoid landslides and erosion processes related to torrential rain but will also preserve agriculture and livestock production, water availability for human consumption and ecologic water flows that work as a driving engine of numerous hydroelectric plants. Other measures like the increase of carbon stocks through forest restoration and ecosystem conservation will also have a positive impact to mitigation measures.</p> <p>Furthermore, Ecuador&rsquo;s ecosystems show high levels of vulnerability to climate change. This is due, apart from the aforementioned effects derived from water resource impacts, to the need to consider the fragmentation of habitats and the degradation to which natural areas are exposed which increases exposure to the impacts of climate change in this sector and upsurges vulnerability levels. Moreover, ecosystems are a source of environmental goods and services like the protection of lands, water regulation and carbon capture and have clear benefits to the Ecuadorian society, strengthening its climate resilience. These goods and services can be altered by the effects of climate change and their state of&nbsp;conservation as well as their ecologic stability will determine their capacity to resist climate alterations. This way, ecosystem and forest protection as well as the strengthening of the national protected areas systems play a crucial role for the combat of climate change.</p> <p>These actions stress the level of national planning with regards to climate change and highlight the ambition that Ecuador has to address this phenomenon despite its marginal participation in global emissions. Nonetheless, this ambition is linked to financial needs that would allow the country to increase the understanding of long-term climate change impacts (such as precipitation and temperature increase) and the corresponding socioeconomic implication throughout different sectors nationwide.</p> <p>Lastly, Ecuador recognizes that the monitoring and evaluation of adaptation policies and programs is crucial to guarantee that resources are aimed at actions that offer the best opportunities to enhance the resilience of our population.

          "value": "<p>Adaptation Challenges (Climate Change Risks)</p> <p>\"The vulnerability of Egypt's water resources to climate change depends on Nile flows, rainfall, and ground water.</p> <p>In the agricultural sector, climate change studies expect that the productivity of two major crops in Egypt - wheat and maize &ndash;will be reduced by 15% and 19%, respectively, by 2050. Losses in crop productivity are mainly attributed to frequent temperature increase, irrigation water deficit, and pests and plant disease. In addition, 12% to 15% of the most fertile arable land in Nile Delta is negatively affected by sea level rise and salt water intrusion.</p> <p>In terms of livestock production, current evidence shows that temperature rise leads to harmful heat stress, which negatively impacts livestock productivity. New animal&nbsp;diseases have emerged in Egypt, which have strong negative impacts on livestock production. These include bluetongue disease and rift valley fever, which are both attributed to significant changes in the Egyptian climate.</p> <p>Climate change is expected to increase seawater temperature, shifting fish distributions northwards to live in deeper waters. In addition, increased water salinity in the coastal lakes in Egypt is expected to negatively affect fish species.</p> <p>Coastal zones are expected to suffer from climate change direct impacts. These include sea level rise and the overflow of low-level land. Estimations indicate that sea level rise by 50 cm leads to serious impacts on low-level lands in Delta and adjacent highly populated cities such as Alexandria and Port Said. Consequently, this will result in a more significant challenge, which is the migration of people from the affected areas to other areas, thus affecting the efficiency of different services and increasing the financial cost required for their development.</p> <p>As forth tourism sector, coral reefs which constitute a major attraction in Red Sea resorts are highly vulnerable to climate change. In urban areas, heat islands1 formed by hot air arising from the increasing use of energy in buildings represent the main concern in hot arid climates.</p> <p>In addition, one of the most significant potential negative impacts of climate change is the harm inflicted on national heritage as result of temperature rise, sandy winds and ground water. However, this is not just a national concern. Instead, it is a global challenge since this heritage is part of the human heritage.</p> <p>In health sector, climate change increases direct and indirect negative impacts on public health in Egypt. For example, in 2015 the negative impacts are represented in higher death rate due to heat stress.</p> <p>In the energy sector, the increase in temperature negatively affects the efficiency of conventional power plants and photovoltaic cells. Moreover, the sea level rise threatens the electric power plants and networks located along the coasts. Also, the negative impact of climate change on rainfall rates and rain distribution across different regions negatively affects power generation from hydropower plants. This, of course, is in addition to the increased electricity consumption rates as a result of the use of air conditioners.\"</p> <p>Egypt's Intended Actions to Promote Resilience</p> <p>\"a. Water Resources</p> <p>Several measures are currently being considered to adapt to decreasing water resources or increasing Nile flows. These primarily include:</p> <p>- Maintaining water level in Lake Nasser<br />- Increasing water storage capacity<br />- Improving irrigation and draining systems<br />- Changing cropping patterns and farm irrigation systems<br />- Reducing surface water evaporation by redesigning canal cross sections<br />- Developing new water resources through upper Nile projects<br />- Rain water harvesting<br />- Desalination<br />- Treated wastewater recycling<br />- Increased use of deep groundwater reservoirs</p> <p>In addition, public awareness is being raised on the need for rationalizing water use, enhancing precipitation measurement networks in upstream countries of the Nile Basin, encouraging data exchange between Nile Basin countries, and developing Circulation Models to predict the impact of climate change on local and regional water resources.</p> <p>b. Agricultural Security</p> <p>Changing sowing dates and good management practices are among the important adaptation measures oriented to mitigate climate change. Changing cultivars to those that are more tolerant to heat, salinity and pests, and changing crop pattern are the most promising adaptation measures at the national level. Moreover, using different multi-level combinations of improved surface irrigation systems and applying deficit irrigation are successful means of increasing surface irrigation system capacity in traditional lands to overcome the negative impacts of climate change.</p> <p>Concerning livestock, improving the current low productivity of cattle in addition to improving feeding programs are being considered. No clear adaptation options are defined for fishery wealth.</p> <p>There is a dire need for further studies on the impacts and adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector in order to develop an adaptation strategy, which overcomes the barriers to implementing adaptation measures. These barriers include limited scientific information and strategic visions, and lack of financial support.</p> <p>c. Coastal Zones</p> <p>Adaptation options for coastal zones are highly site-dependent. However, changes in land use, integrated coastal zone management, and proactive planning for protecting coastal zones are necessary adaptation policies. Providing job opportunities in safe areas (in locations that are not impacted by climate change) is an important priority to successfully absorb affected population.</p> <p>d. Additional Adaptation Policies and Measures</p> <p>Egyptian authorities are currently focusing on the following additional policies and procedures:</p> <p>- Building institutional capacities of comprehensive collection and analysis of&nbsp;monitoring and observations and geographic data;<br />- Identifying indicators and conducting full assessment of vulnerable sectors and&nbsp;stakeholders;<br />- Enforcing environmental regulations;<br />- Identifying and applying protection measures of vulnerable touristic and&nbsp;archaeological sites and roads against extreme natural phenomena such as&nbsp;floods, dust storms and extreme weather conditions;<br />- Building capacities for using regional water circulation models<br />- Proactive planning and integrated coastal zone management<br />- Risk reduction; and<br />- Increasing awareness of stakeholders for energy and water utilization\"</p> <p>Adaptation Action Packages</p> <p>\"Coastal Zones:</p> <p>1. Reduce climate change associated risks and disasters.<br />2. Capacity building of the Egyptian society to adapt to climate change and associated risks and disasters.<br />3. Enhance national and regional partnership in managing crises and disasters related to climate change and the reduction of associated risk.</p> <p>Water Resources and Irrigation:</p> <p>1- Increase investments in modern irrigation systems.<br />2- Cooperate with Nile Basin countries to reduce water evaporation and increase river capacity.<br />3- Develop national policies to encourage citizens on water use rationalization.</p> <p>Agricultural Sector:</p> <p>1- Build an effective institutional system to manage climate change associated crises and disasters at the national level.<br />2- Activate genetic diversity of plant species with maximum productivity.<br />3- Achieve biological diversity of all livestock, fishery, and poultry elements to protect them and ensure food security.<br />4- Develop agro-economic systems and new structures to manage crops, fisheries and animal production, which are resilient to climate changes.<br />5- Increase the efficiency of irrigation water use, while maintaining crop productivity and protecting land from degradation.<br />6- Review of new and existing land use policies and agricultural expansion programs to take into account possibilities of land degradation in Delta and other affected areas resulting from Mediterranean Sea level rise.<br />7- Develop systems, programs and policies to protect rural community and support its adaptive capacity to the expected trend in land use change, plant and animal production, and internal migration due to climate change.</p> <p>Health Sector:</p> <p>1- Identify potential health risks as a result of climate change.<br />2- Raise community awareness about climate change risks and means of adaptation.<br />3- Increase the efficiency of healthcare sector and improve the quality of health services in dealing with climate change.<br />4- Support Ministry of Health efforts to improve the social and economic status and population characteristics.</p> <p>Rural Areas, Population, and Roads</p> <p>1- Draw a baseline scenario for the optimal regional distribution of population and economic activities within the geographical boundaries of Egypt up to the year 2100, taking climate change into consideration.</p> <p>Tourism Sector</p> <p>1- Reduce climate change risks in touristic areas.<br />2- Engage users in supporting the proposed strategy.<br />3- Support periodical monitoring and observations systems and follow-up bodies.<br />4- Raise environmental awareness.<br />5- Cooperate with international bodies.<br />6- Incorporate disaster risks within the plans to promote sustainable tourism in Egypt.<br />7- Capacity building of local communities in touristic areas.</p> <p>Energy Sector</p> <p>1- Conduct comprehensive studies to assess the impact of climate change on the energy sector, propose appropriate adaptation measures, and estimate the economic cost of the proposed adaptation measures.

Unique geographical location, complex dissected relief, land cover diversity and specific climate, containing almost every type of climatic zones, set conditions for wide variety of negative consequences of climate change in Georgia: (a) due to sea level rise and other factors Black Sea has affected certain areas of land, destroyed and/or damaged houses and infrastructure along the coast; (b) in highlands, growing frequency and intensity of floods, flashfloods, landslides and mudflows have caused a huge amount of damage in the economy; (c) due to decreased rainfall and enhanced evaporation semi-arid regions in Eastern Georgia are under the threat of desertification; (d) more frequent and intensive heat waves have affected human health; (e) rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, reduced water availability, forest fires, pests and diseases have worsen the growth and productivity of forests. (f) Rising temperatures, increased winds and reduced water availability have significantly declined agricultural productivity.</p> <p>In case of a 2<sup>0</sup>C or higher increase in global warming, effects will become more severe in the future. This will create an extra burden on the development of society. Accordingly, adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change is one of the main priorities for the Government of Georgia. The National Adaptation Plan will be prepared in order to further advance the implementation of adaptation actions. The main objective of the Government of Georgia is to improve country's preparedness and adaptive capacity by developing climate resilient practices that reduce vulnerability of highly exposed communities. In this regard, Georgia takes steps to integrate climate risk and resilience into core development planning and implementation.</p> <p>Georgia's agricultural sector plays a key role in the country's economy. Georgian farmers are going to fulfill a principal role in providing one of the fundamental needs of society: a safe, secure, and affordable food supply. This underlines the importance of the relationship between climate change impacts on agriculture and food security. During last decades negative consequences of climate change have drastically reduced agricultural productivity. For example, severe drought in 2000 has reduced the production of cereals close to zero; due to the prolonged drought almost 400,000 hectares of agricultural lands have been damaged. Within the last decade the occurrence of droughts in Eastern Georgia increased, the severe droughts have been observed every year accompanied with high temperatures (40-42⁰) doubling the frequency of the occurrence of the intense droughts in the region.</p> <p>For the adaptation of agricultural sector to the expected climate change, wide range of measures is planned. Those include, but are not limited to the following: (a) research and development of emergency response plans for agriculture dealing with droughts, floods, etc; (b) Introduction of innovative irrigation management and water application techniques; (c) implementation of various site specific anti-erosion measures; (d) establishment of information centers for farmers that provides guidance on adaptive management of agriculture; etc.</p> <p>A complex mountainous topography makes the country more prone to the climate extremes and related events. Georgia is vulnerable to natural hazards including floods, flash floods, droughts, landslides, avalanches, and mud flows. Many of these extreme events have been recorded in the last two-three decades, the most recent one happening on the 13th of June 2015 in Tbilisi. The flash-flood was distinctive not only due to the high casualty (19 people dead and huge economic loss (around 100 million USD) but reconnecting to the fact that it was characterized by 9 different types of hydro-meteorological and geological extremes, occurring simultaneously within a very limited area. These weather extremes additionally result in changing of the hydrology of rivers, posing a serious impact on continuous water availability for drinking, irrigation and energy. Establishment of Early warning systems for climate related extreme events is considered as priority measure by the Government of Georgia.</p> <p>Sea level rise impacts are projected to induce multiple negative consequences in coastal zone of Georgia. It is imperative to assess and implement adaptation measures in order to minimize economic losses. Combination of various coastal zone protection technologies are recommended by the second \"Technology Needs Assessment\" report of Georgia to prevent the significant damage caused by the Black Sea level rise. According to the National communications of Georgia to the UNFCCC costs of the coastline adaptation program is estimated about 600 million USD. In absence of adaptation measures the estimated losses only in the tourism sector will reach about 2 billion USD by 2030. Due to very high social costs involved, priority will be given to the integrated coastal planning and management instruments, rather than investments in coastal erosion abatement only.</p> <p>Without international support Georgia is unable to cope with adverse effects of climate change. \"Lima Call for Climate Action\" (Decision 1/CP.20) <em>\"Urges developed country Parties to provide and mobilize enhanced financial support to developing country Parties for ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions</em>\".</p> <p>According to the expert judgment estimated economic losses without adaptation measures during 2021-2030 will be about 10-12 billion USD, while adaptation measures will cost within 1.5-2 billion USD. Accessing finance that allows Georgia to adapt to the impacts of climate change is crucial. To estimate required financial support the following pre-2020 activities are planned: (a) prioritize selected adaptation policies and measures based on national circumstances and identify associated financial needs; (b) evaluate domestic sources of finances; and (c) determine need and sources for external financial support.</p> <p>Georgia needs international support for the development and transfer of technologies to increase its adaptive capacity. In this regard technologies for the protection of coastal infrastructure; technologies for sustainable water management; sustainable agricultural technologies; and technologies for sustainable forest management are prioritized.</p> <p>The implementation of adaptation actions for the period 2021 &ndash; 2030 requires the continuous development and strengthening of Georgia's capacities, in particular: (a) national capacity to develop adaptation strategies; (b) policy makers capacity for climate change adaptation planning; (c) capacity of communities to reduce their vulnerability to adverse impacts of future climate hazards; (d) capacity of national health system institutions, to respond to and manage long-term climate change-sensitive health risks.</p> <p>It is fundamental to incorporate a gender- and human rights-sensitive approach in adaptation planning capacity building, prioritizing the most vulnerable sectors and regions in order to reduce social inequality and the gap between women and men rights\".</p>"

          "value": "<p>\"Climate change adaptation is a priority for Lebanon. Being a developing country with scarce water resources and high population density in the coastal areas, Lebanon is already facing and will continue to face several challenges as a result of climate change (Second National Communication, SNC, 2011). According to the climate models, temperatures are expected to increase by around 1&deg;C on the coast and 2&deg;C in the mainland by 2040, and by 2090 they will be 3.5&deg;C and 5&deg;C higher, respectively. At the same time rainfall is projected to decrease by 10-20% by 2040 and 25-45% by the year 2090. This will lead to substantial detrimental effects in a number of areas. Lebanon has a diverse natural environment including coastal, agricultural, forest and mountainous areas many of which have unique biodiversity and ecosystems that are sensitive to climate change.</p> <p>Lebanon&rsquo;s electricity infrastructure needs to cope with increased demand for cooling. Temperature increases are expected to cause approximately 2,400-5,200 additional deaths annually by 2030, which need to be acted on in the public health sector (SNC, 2011). Tourism needs to adjust to rising sea levels, warmer temperatures and shrinking snow cover in the mountains resulting from an increase in temperature.</p> <p>Lebanon&rsquo;s arid / semi-arid climate makes it poor in water resources availability and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; the projected changes in rainfall will put tremendous pressure on national water security and produce knock-on effects in sectors such as agriculture, where around 70% of the available water is being used for irrigation. Given the projected decrease in precipitation, there is an immediate need to increase water resources through the designing and commissioning of dams and hill lakes as well as artificially re-charging the groundwater. In addition, there is a need to optimize the use of current water resources through the rehabilitation of the existing network and the installation of water meters. Lebanon is already undertaking major initiatives to ensure the availability of affordable water for domestic, industrial and agricultural use, in line with the National Water Sector Strategy (2012). However, more technical, financial and capacity building support and technology transfer is needed to optimize water storage, water use efficiency, improve irrigation systems and demonstrate reuse of wastewater.</p> <p>To reduce these adverse impacts on environmental, economic and social systems, Lebanon will promote climate change adaptation through mainstreaming and building institutional capacity. The National Sustainable Development Strategy, which is currently under preparation in cooperation with the Council of Ministers, clearly highlights the importance of adaptation and points out necessary action in nearly all of its sectoral chapters. The objective is to provide security and well-being for the Lebanese people whilst increasing the resilience to climate change. Yet climate change is one of many challenges to national development in Lebanon: population growth, rapid urbanization and geopolitical location provide additional challenges, and addressing these should be pursued simultaneously to avoid working in silos through collaboration between multiple government ministries and agencies, the private sector and other relevant stakeholders.</p> <p>Lebanon has already made progress in mainstreaming climate change adaptation into the biodiversity (draft National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, NBSAP, 2015), water (National Water Sector Strategy, 2012), forestry and agriculture (National Forest Plan, NFP, 2015 and Ministry of Agriculture Strategy, 2015) sectors. The key actions included in these strategies are listed in Table 1 below. The actions reflect Lebanon&rsquo;s priorities given the 4 current understanding of expected climate impacts. Sectoral strategies will be assessed regularly as part of the national development process and/or when new information about climate change and impacts become available.</p> <p>Furthermore Lebanon aims to reach land degradation neutrality by 2030, in line with the recommendations by the UNCCD framework. This has recently been agreed by the Committee on Land Degradation and Desertification, led by the Ministry of Agriculture. Detailed adaptation measures to suit this aim are yet to be developed.</p> <p>Lebanon also continues promoting climate change adaptation in other vulnerable sectors by seeking to mainstream climate change adaptation into electricity infrastructure, tourism, human settlements and infrastructure, and public health sectors. The Climate Change Coordination Committee will thrive to continue to examine sectoral vulnerabilities, assess priorities and design/guide actions in cooperation with concerned ministries to increase resilience and minimize impacts of adverse climate change effects. The work will build on the sectoral vulnerability assessments completed for the Third National Communication as well as on other relevant studies.\"</p> <p>See Lebanon's full INDC submission for \"Table 1: Key adaptation measures in the biodiversity, forestry and agriculture, and water sectors.\"</p>"

Being located in the centre of the southwest monsoon area of South East Asia, heavy-rain induced floods occur in many parts of the country which is crossed by large river systems and the Delta. The nation&rsquo;s coastal area covers more than 50% of the entire eastern side of the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea and is therefore particularly prone to cyclones and associated strong winds, heavy rains and storm surges. Droughts are frequent, particularly in central Myanmar. Importantly, the largest part of the total 51.4 million population (2014 census) is concentrated in the Ayeyarwaddy basin area, so it sustains many significant socio-economic sectors and many livelihoods. The population is concentrated in two main areas: the Delta area (~50,400 km2 ) which is most exposed to recurring tropical storms, cyclones and floods and potential storm surge, and the &lsquo;Dry Zone&rsquo; area, which is exposed to chronic droughts. In 2014, 70% of the population that resided in rural areas and depended on rain-fed agriculture, livestock and fishery and forest resources. According to the National Implementation Report of the Department of National Planning in 2012-13, the agriculture sector contributed 32.9% of national GDP. The livelihood of rural communities and the productivity of the agricultural sector as a whole are therefore largely influenced by climate conditions in these areas.</p> <p>The economy of Myanmar and its society is therefore highly sensitive and vulnerable to climate change, climate variability and natural disasters. Adaptation to the changing climate is a priority. However the capacity to reduce risk and mitigate the effects of climate change is limited due to lack of technical, human resources, financial and legislative processes. This results in significant loss and damage, hampering the process of national development.</p> <p>Myanmar&rsquo;s population recurrently suffers from loss of life and damage to infrastructure as a result of climate related disasters. Climatic changes have been recorded in the last six decades and they include increased temperatures, changes in total rainfall (increasing in some regions and decreasing in others), decreases in the duration of the south-west monsoon season as a result of late onset and early start times, and increases in the recurrence and severity of extreme weather events, such as floods, cyclones and droughts. Importantly, models predict ever more extreme changes in temperature, drought periods, changing rainfall patterns, increased risk of flooding, cyclones and strong winds, flood/storm surges, intense rains and sea-level rises along the nation&rsquo;s significantly long coastline by 2100. In line with vision (as stated in section 1 - National Circumstances section), Myanmar, after cyclone Nargis in 2008, has consistently invested in improving national capacity to respond to and recover from such disasters by reconstructing in a sustainable manner which will mitigate future loss and damage. However, the dimension and scale of the challenges to achieve sustainable rehabilitation are beyond the nation&rsquo;s current capacity. Myanmar therefore requires continuing support in this regard.

The country, with the exception of some isolated pockets, has become warmer. Data on trends from 1975 to 2005 showed 0.06&deg;C rise in temperature annually whereas mean rainfall has significantly decreased on an average of 3.7 mm (-3.2%) per month per decade. Under various climate change scenarios, mean annual temperatures are projected to increase between 1.3-3.8&deg;C by the 2060s and 1.8-5.8&deg;C by the 2090s. Annual precipitation is projected to reduce in a range of 10 to 20 % across the country.</p> <p>In Nepal&rsquo;s Himalaya, total estimated ice reserve between 1977 and 2010 decreased by 29 percent (129 km3). The number of glacier lakes increased by 11 percent and glaciers recede on an average by 38 km2 per year during the same period. Hence, climate change has visible and pronounced impacts on snows and glaciers that are likely to increase the possibilities of Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). Nepal has suffered from increased frequency of extreme weather events such as landslides, floods and droughts resulting in the loss of human lives as well as high social and economic costs.</p> <p>The 2013 study on Economic Impact Assessment of Climate Change in Key Sectors (agriculture, hydropower and water-induced disasters) has estimated direct cost of current climate variability and extreme events equivalent to 1.5 to 2 percent of current GDP/year (approximately USD 270-360 million/year in 2013 prices) and much higher in extreme years. In the case of hydropower, the model projected lower dry season flows and thus lower energy availability. The additional energy generation capacity needed to meet future demand under this scenario, due to climate change, was estimated at 2800 MW by 2050 with an increase in costs of USD 2.6 billion (present value) for the period through to 2050. Overall, the economic costs of climate change in Nepal for these three sectors could be equivalent to 2-3% of current GDP/year by mid-century.</p> <p>Overall, Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, water-induced disasters and hydro-meteorological extreme events such as droughts, storms, floods, inundation, landslides, debris flow, soil erosion and avalanches. Based on National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) 2010, out of 75 districts, 29 districts are highly vulnerable to landslides, 22 districts to drought, 12 districts to GLOFs, and 9 districts to flooding.</p> <p>Nepal is ranked as the eleventh most earthquake-prone country in the world. It experienced a devastating earthquake of 7.6 magnitudes on 25 April 2015 with around 9,000 casualties and over 22,000 injuries. The destruction was widespread as it ruined houses, heritage sites, schools, health posts, infrastructures (roads, bridges and hydro-electricity plants) and social systems (water supply, agricultural land, trekking routes, and sports facilities). Lives of about 8 million people have been severely impacted by this earthquake demanding unbelievably high cost of reconstruction.</p> <p>Earthquake and climate-induced disasters have accelerated vulnerabilities and risks to water, sanitation and food security resulting in further aggravation of country's vulnerabilities to climatic hazards.\"</p><p>Adaptation Actions</p> <p>\"The Government of Nepal also realizes the importance of reducing climate change impacts and implements climate adaptation actions to protect life and improve livelihoods of the climate vulnerable communities and also improve ecosystem services.

Localising climate adaptation actions has been deeply rooted in planning and implementation of NCCSP target areas. Additional efforts are underway to promote climate change adaptation into planning and programming processes.</p> <p>b. Building Climate Resilience</p> <p>The Government has accorded high priority to build climate resilience by integrating it into policies, strategies and programmes. At present, projects such as building climate resilient watersheds in mountainous eco-regions, building resilience to climate related hazards, mainstreaming climate change risk management in development, and building climate resilient communities through private sector participation are under various stages of implementation and are contributing to develop human resources so as to integrate climate change concerns in sectoral plans and programmes.</p> <p>Nepal&rsquo;s PPCR compromises four components i) Building Climate Resilience of Watersheds in Mountain Eco regions, ii) Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards, iii) Mainstreaming Climate Change Risk Management in Development, and iv) Building Climate Resilient Communities through Private Sector Participation. All the PPCR Components have been launched and are at different stages of implementation. The ongoing programs are complimenting each other and varied Climate change programs in Nepal including those to implement LAPAs and other NAPA priorities.\"</p><p>See Nepal's full INDC submission for additional information on adaptation policies, plans, etc.</p>"

          "value": "<p>Adaptation</p> <p>\"The Government of the Republic of Nauru considers the focus of its INDC to be primarily adaptation, with a strong emphasis on building resilience which also encompasses mitigation in an integrated manner. Through this approach the INDC serves to highlight our national sustainable development priorities, which encompass adaptation priorities. These include identifying current gaps and needs for support in terms of addressing adaptation on the ground.ThisINDC does not constitute additional commitments from Nauru. Rather, Nauru views its planned adaptation actions, and broader focus on building resilience, as part of the international commitment to Nauru under the UNFCCC.</p> <p>Climate change adds to the already significant challenges of achieving the NSDS goals and it undermines food and water security, erode coastlines, damage marine ecosystems and will impede on progress already made. The impacts of climate change will also add extra burden to the national budget diverting resources away from other important sectors and activities such as education, health and economic development. Therefore, addressing climate change in the context of sustainable development means that there will be co- benefits for not only achieving the NSDS but also in building the resilience of Nauru to climate change.</p> <p>Vulnerability in the case of Nauru is a combination of different factors including climate change. The NSDS outlines Nauru&rsquo;s main social, economic and environmental challenges, and key development priorities. These developmental and environmental challenges illustrate Nauru&rsquo;s vulnerability to external stresses and risks, including those posed by climate change. At the national and community scale in Nauru, some of the factors that create vulnerability are: scarce water resources; limited land and soil resources; environmental degradation; high concentration of income activities; dependence on imports; geographical isolation; low human capacity; chronic health problems; aid dependency; and risk of climate change and disaster. Further priorities are expected to emerge over time as Nauru increases its capacity to respond to vulnerability and risk or its lack of capacity to respond.</p> <p>Nauru has taken successful steps to establish our RONAdapt as part of our national efforts to prepare for adaptation.The RONAdapt represents the Government of Nauru&rsquo;s response to the risks to climate change and disaster risk reduction and is therefore aligned with the development priorities embedded in the NSDS. It is intended to support achievement of our NSDS goals, by highlighting a series of actions that will also reduce Nauru&rsquo;s vulnerability to climate change and disasters. In doing so, it will improve the country&rsquo;s social, economic and environmental resilience.</p> <p>Priority actions are given to those that will work towards the goals in the NSDS, as well as those in sectoral plans and strategies where these already give consideration to climate change and disaster risks. The priorities outlined targets the following goals:</p> <ul> <li>Water security;</li> <li>Energy security;</li> <li>Food security;</li> <li>A healthy environment;</li> <li>A healthy people</li> <li>Productive, secure land resources.</li> </ul> <p>High priorities are given to actions that can contribute towards multiple development and resilience objectives simultaneously, often cross cutting across sectors. The priority actions are arranged under sectors targeting the following areas: water; health; agriculture; energy; land management and rehabilitation; infrastructure and coastal protection; biodiversity and environment; community development and social inclusion; and education and human capacity development. However, as highlighted earlier, the actions generally contribute to the goals of multiple sectors and at the same time to the overall NSDS goals.</p> <p>Nauru faces a multitude of challenges, barriers and gaps. These include information gaps, limited capacity both institutional and human, and the unavailability of appropriate adaptation technology and lack of funds at the national level. Lack of funding at the national level has prevented many larger infrastructure projects from getting underway, such as a new hospital, electricity transmission system, improvements to port and airport, and land rehabilitation. At the national level, there are no nationally focussed adaptation projects due largely to the very limited funds available at the national level. At the regional level, Nauru is also involved in a relatively low but increasing number of adaptation projects and programmes and through the regional projects and programmes, some actions are being implemented on the ground that addresses the needs in relation to coastal zone management, water, capacity building, gender, policy and planning.</p> <p>Addressing the challenges, barriers and gaps are therefore important for building the resilience of Nauru. These can be addressed through building and strengthening the information gap that are vital for planning and management in many sectors as sectors are currently constrained by poor information about current conditions and/or likely future changes. Strengthening institutions are also important actions and undertakings for adaptation in Nauru and this includes the finalisation of policies and plans that have only been progressed to draft form. Strengthening institutions for Nauru will also entail the need to build the human capacity of sectors. Human capacity is a critical part of capacity building in Nauru and is currently a major weakness in almost every sector. This could be addressed through activities funded and/or implemented with support of external partners, aiming to maximise opportunities for skills transfer to local staff and/or communities and to require future externally funded development projects, including those focused on climate change adaptation and disaster risk management to emphasise skills transfer components. In addition, the up-skilling of local staff should be a core priority of all project activities, since it will help position Nauru better to be able to respond to an array of future challenges, including planning for and responding to climate change and disasters.</p> <p>The need for development of new technologies and transfer of existing appropriate technologies for adaptation in Nauru cannot be overstated. Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) will help countries like Nauru track their needs for new equipment, techniques, services, capacities and skills necessary to build resilience to climate change. However, TNA has not been initiated in Nauru due to various constraints including lack of institutional, human and financial capacity. The preparation of a detailed technology needs for adaptation is an important next step.</p> <p>Implementation of many of the adaptation priorities will be heavily dependent on resources being made available by external development partners, to supplement limited domestic</p> <p>funds. While dedicated climate funds are available at the international level, these can be challenging to access for a small country like Nauru. Therefore, Nauru intends to place considerable emphasis on working with its bilateral partners, regional agencies, for the financial and technical resources needed to implement its adaptation priorities, including the improvement of access and facilitation to international climate finance.</p> <p>Responsibility for implementing climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction related activities is shared across different parts of government and the community. However, at the operational level, the Department of Environment under the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Environment (CIE) has the primary responsibility for coordination, monitoring progress and reporting on the RONAdapt implementation of Nauru&rsquo;s climate change activities at all government department/sector levels.</p> <p>Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) are critical tasks for tracking progress on the implementation of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction priorities and goals. The M&amp;E framework for adaptation reflects the desire for tracking and for learning, but also recognises the limited institutional, human and financial resources available in Nauru to dedicate to M&amp;E.</p> <p>The priority activities highlighted in the RONAdapt require, in most cases, further development through some additional steps before they are ready to be implemented. The financial costs for the activities are not provided, since there is insufficient detail on individual activities to be able to accurately indicate costs. The preparation of detailed cost estimates is an important next step in implementing each activity and it is expected to be undertaken in conjunction with the process of detailed design of the activities.\"</p> <p>Loss and Damage from climate change</p> <p>\"Loss and damage is a significant issue for Nauru. The inclusion of loss and damage in the INDC is twofold. First, its purpose is to highlight the significance of the issue for Nauru and second, to present our views on loss and damage in the 2015 climate agreement.</p> <p>The reality of the impacts of climate change that Nauru and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are already experiencing means adaptation is absolutely critical. However, the science is telling us that we are quickly moving towards a reality where adapting will not be sufficient. The prospect for loss and damage associated with climate change for Nauru and SIDS are real. The IPCC findings in both the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Report from Working Group II show that there are substantial limits and barriers to adaptation. In Warsaw, Parties also acknowledged that loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change involves more than that which can be reduced by adaptation.</p> <p>The climate change projection for Nauru is expected to increase sea surface temperatures, rise in sea levels, ocean acidification and changes in ocean currents. These will in turn, impact on the whole of Nauru. The ability of corals and invertebrates to form will be affected by ocean acidification; coral bleaching will increase as a result of higher sea-surface temperatures; and the abundance of key oceanic fish species will be affected by changes to ocean currents, such as the Southern Equatorial Current, and to the area and location of the PEQD and the Warm Pool and their convergence. Sea level rise threatens to increase saltwater intrusion into precious groundwater reserves as well as to exacerbate coastal erosion and flooding during storm events, and changes in rainfall patterns will likely affect water scarcity, while important fish resources may be affected by changes in ocean temperature and acidification.</p> <p>Nauru calls for loss and damage to be included as a separate element of the 2015 agreement, one that is separate and distinct from adaptation. Loss and damage must be addressed in a robust, consistent and sustained manner. This can only be accomplished through a loss and damage mechanism that is anchored in the 2015 agreement. Anchoring the mechanism in the 2015 agreement will ensure that it is permanent.</p> <p>Defining the relationship between mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage needs to be considered and reflected in the 2015 agreement, including a clearly defined relationship between mitigation ambition, adaptation costs as well as loss and damage, particularly when mitigation ambitions are currently grossly inadequate and adaptation measures are not sufficient to address climate impacts.</p> <p>There is also an urgent need for technical work to be undertaken and should include an assessment of impacts and risks at different levels of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and warming, including 1.5 &deg;C, especially the risks of ocean acidification, global and regional sea level rise and irreversible changes in the physical, ecological and human systems, including for specific regions and key sectors and systems. Observations and projections relevant to local and regional circumstances should cover exposure and vulnerability to climate change, the resulting impacts, adaptation options and loss and damage.</p> <p>Nauru acknowledges that there is on-going work under the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage, including a 2016 Review, and expects that the results of this on-going work be integrated into the mechanism that is anchored in the 2015 agreement.</p> <p>Immediate and adequate financial, technical and capacity building support for loss and damage is needed and to be provided on a timely basis for Nauru and other SIDS to address loss and damage. It is beyond our current national means to address loss and damage from climate change and financial flows from developed countries for addressing loss and damage in Nauru and other vulnerable developing countries should be new and additional to financing for those for mitigation and adaptation.\"</p>"

Adaptation with mitigation co-benefits: The following adaptation measures are expected to have significant mitigation co-benefits, depending on their degree of implementation and availability of funds to pursue planned activities:</p> <p>1.1. Water and waste water management: Implement actions that will promote and encourage the reduction, recycle and reuse of water and wastewater in the municipal, industrial and commercial sectors in a manner that will reduce energy consumption, desalinated water production and unground leakage.<br />1.2. Urban planning: Encourage actions that promote the development and use of mass transport systems in urban areas. Take the necessary actions to expedite the development of the metro system in Riyadh. In addition support and expedite the planning and development of metro systems in Jeddah and Dammam.<br />1.3. Marine Protection: Implement coastal management strategies that are designed to reduce coastal erosion, increase the sinks for blue carbon, maintain related ecosystems and address the threats that climate change poses for marine livelihoods. Support the planting of mangrove seedlings along its coasts. In addition, strengthen and enhance the coral reef restoration program throughout the northwestern Arabian Gulf.<br />1.4. Reduced desertification: Undertake measures to enhance desertification management. Support actions that will promote the stabilization of sand movements around cities and roads, while increasing sinks for capacity through using green belts as barriers. Develop and enhance arid and semi-arid rural areas through various natural resource conservation activities, biodiversity and eco-system based adaptation efforts. The objective is to improve soil quality, water, pasture and wildlife resources through a system of protected areas and reserves. Mitigation co-benefits may include those relating to reducing land degradation and improving land management practices, especially for agriculture and forestry.</p> <p>2. Adaptation undertakings: The following adaptation contributions are expected to support Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s efforts to address climate change and raise resilience to its impacts:</p> <p>2.1. Integrated coastal zone management planning (ICZM): Take the necessary action to develop and implement ICZM plans that would take into account the protection of coastal infrastructures such as roads, residential areas, industrial complexes, desalination plants, seaports, etc.;<br />2.2. Early Warning Systems (EWS): Develop and operationalize EWS that would reduce vulnerability due to extreme weather events such as rainstorms, floods and dust storms by increasing resilience of infrastructure;<br />2.3. Integrated water management planning: Develop and implement plans that will harness new sources of freshwater, construct additional dams for collection of drinking water and recharging of aquifers.\"</p> <p>Addressing Response Measures</p> <p>\"Saudi Arabia will take the necessary actions to understand international policy measures to response to climate change, assess the implications of these measures on its economy, and take necessary steps to raise its resilience to these impacts. International cooperation in addressing response measures is important for the Kingdom to achieve its sustainable development objectives and realize its ambitions in addressing climate change; these include:</p> <p>1. Socio-economic research studies to assess the impacts of mitigation policy measures implemented outside Saudi Arabia on the Saudi economy, including collection of information and development of modelling tools.</p> <p>2.

As an LDC and African country, Sudan is amongst the most vulnerable countries to the adverse effects of climate change. As such, adaptation is the first and overriding priority of Sudan&rsquo;s climate actions and hence constitutes a major part of Sudan&rsquo;s INDC. Sudan&rsquo;s A-INDC is informed by and builds on its current commitments under Article 4.1 of the Convention, with the understanding that provisions, particularly Articles 4.3, 4.4 and 4.7 are being applied, i.e. full incremental costs being provided by Annex II Parties, as well as provisions under Article 12 in relation to adaptation. It also builds on the various adaptation-related mechanisms and processes under the Convention, including, above all, Sudan&rsquo;s NAPA (2007), Sudan&rsquo;s INC and SNC (2003; 2012), TNA (2013), and particularly Sudan&rsquo;s NAP.\"</p> <p>Aim/Objective</p> <p>\"The overall aim of Sudan&rsquo;s INDC is based on the objective of Sudan&rsquo;s NAP, i.e. to contribute to sustainable development and reduce poverty by reducing the long-term negative impacts of climate change.

The NAPA document will be launched on 12 November 2015. The NAPA and the INDC will form the basis of South Sudan&rsquo;s adaptation strategy.</p> <p>A sectoral approach has been adopted in this INDC, though in South Sudan, the technical assessments on vulnerabilities, hazards, and priority sectors is limited. Priority actions are based on observed adverse effects of climate change on the sectors. Further assessments into specific actions and needs is required. INDC includes priority actions in the following sectors:</p> <p><em>Agriculture and livestock</em></p> <p>Agriculture and livestock are the main livelihood of the majority of the population. South Sudan will thus embark on promoting sustainable, climatesmart agriculture and livestock production and management. The country will prioritise the enhancement of climate resilience in the agricultural sector (crop production, livestock, fisheries) through the promotion of climate-smart agriculture, livestock improvement, enhancement of fisheries productivity and soil erosion control. This will be achieved by building upon traditional knowledge and supporting community- based adaptation strategies.</p> <p>Given the frequent droughts experienced in the country, a major priority is promoting the harvesting and retention of water for different uses. This will be implemented through community-based watershed management with a focus on maintaining the quality and quantity of water resources for multiple uses and stakeholders.</p> <p><em>Health:</em></p> <p>To accurately identify climate change impacts in the health sector, South Sudan will conduct comprehensive vulnerability assessments concerning human health and well-being under current and future climate scenarios. This will inform actions to improve early warning systems for climate-related disease outbreaks (e.g. malaria) and establishing contingency plans to develop climate changeresilient health systems. Public health systems will be strengthened by building hospitals (including regional referral hospitals) and supplying them with medicine, equipment and personnel trained on treating climate-related diseases. Adapting Vulnerable Communities to Climate Change</p> <p>Poverty is a determining factor of climate change vulnerability in South Sudan. Poverty is widespread, particularly in the rural areas &ndash; which are home to more than 6.9 million people. Approximately 51% of South Sudan&rsquo;s population lives below the national consumption poverty line. People living in poverty do not have the financial capacity to cope with climate change. Furthermore, these people are often compelled to live in high-risk areas that are prone to floods and droughts. This also has to take into account gender equality and human rights.</p> <p>Actions to reduce vulnerability of the population to climate induced hazards are the following:</p> <p>i. Enhance access to water in light of growing climate threats through integrated watershed management, wetland management and improved waste management.<br />ii. Enhance food security under a changing climate through the introduction of climate-smart agricultural techniques and irrigated agriculture.<br />iii. Ensure capacity building and participation of the society, local communities, indigenous peoples, women, men, youth, civil organizations and private sector in national and subnational climate change planning.<br />iv. Establish/rehabilitate the hydro-meteorological monitoring network to collect climatic information and provide flood and drought early warning.<br />v. Strengthen the adaptive capacity of the population through transparent and inclusive mechanisms of social participation in the implementation of adaptation interventions, designed with a gender and human rights approach.<br />vi. Reduce vulnerability of population by integrating climate change considerations into land use planning.<br />vii. Increase investments in disaster prevention mechanisms, such as early warning systems, rather than disaster response mechanisms. viii. Improve environmental health-related infrastructure to reduce the spread of water-borne diseases which will be exacerbated by climate change.<br />ix. Create buffer zones and relocate vulnerable communities away from flood-prone areas.</p> <p><em>Forests, Biodiversity and Ecosystems </em></p> <p>In South Sudan, there is a large diversity of ecosystems that provide society with a wide range of environmental services such as carbon sequestration, provision and maintenance of water resources, flood mitigation, provision of food and NTFPs, and the formation and maintenance of soils. These ecosystem services are seriously threatened by human activities and by the effects of climate change.</p> <p>South Sudan is home to the largest designated Ramsar wetland of environmental importance, the Sudd, which is pivotal in regulating the weather patterns in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the greater East Africa region. The Sudd acts as a barrier to the southward encroachment of the Sahara desert and its preservation and management is consequently expected to be South Sudan&rsquo;s most significant contribution toward buffering against the impacts of climate change at the regional level.</p> <p>Ecosystem-based adaptation consists of the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an integrated adaptation strategy to assist human communities to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.</p> <p>Given the reliance of the majority of the population on forest resources, adaptation priorities in this sector include supporting forest governance, reducing over reliance on forest products by providing alternative incomegenerating activities and encouraging planting of climate-resilient tree species. This will be further supported by the development of mechanisms to ensure equitable sharing of benefits accrued from the forest resources.</p> <p>Actions for the sector:</p> <p>i. Promote agro-forestry practices as a way of diversifying land production systems and promoting alternative livelihood options.<br />ii. Promote afforestation of degraded landscapes/watersheds using multi- use forest species to increase community safety-nets and diversify livelihoods.<br />iii. Develop forest reserves and management plans to protect watersheds and improve future water availability.<br />iv. Promote alternative sources of energy to reduce deforestation and the consequent loss of livelihood options.<br />v. Improve the enforcement of environmental regulations.<br />vi. Establish conservancies and protected areas to buffer local communities and biodiversity against climate change impacts.<br />vii. Establish water points for wildlife in protected areas to reduce the negative effects of droughts on animal populations.<br />viii. Increase awareness of local communities on climate change and environmental protection.<br />ix. Introduce fire management plans to prevent the spread of wildfires during periods of drought.<br />x. Introduce an integrated natural resource management approach.</p> <p><em>Infrastructure</em></p> <p>Strategic infrastructure &ndash; including communications, transport, tourism, energy, sanitation, water and waste management &ndash; is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate climate change criteria as part of its design, construction and throughout its useful life span, in order to reduce its vulnerability and increase its resilience.</p> <p>To address potential impacts related to damages to infrastructure, South Sudan will invest in making existing and new buildings more climate resilient. This will be achieved through inter alia ensuring that land-use plans and building codes reflect the expected impacts of climate change and the need to make public and private buildings more climate-resilient.</p> <p>Actions for infrastructure:&nbsp;</p> <p>i. Improve urban and industrial waste water treatment, ensuring quantity and good quality of water in human settlements.<br />ii. Incorporate adaptation criteria for public investment projects, particularly those to be carried out under the Comprehensive Agriculture Development Plan and the Irrigation Development Master Plan.<br />iii. Ensure that land-use plans and building codes reflect the expected impacts of climate change. Institutional and policy actions</p> <p>At the institutional and policy level, there is a need to coordinate climate change actions and mainstream climate change concerns into all sectors through capacity building and the development of policies, strategies and action plans to adapt to climate change.</p> <p>To support decision-making for climate change adaptation, South Sudan will implement actions to assemble, analyze, predict and disseminate climate information through improve climate monitoring and data management systems. Based on this, the relevant data and information will be used to develop early warning systems and inform appropriate responses to extreme climatic events.\"</p>"

In 2012, total greenhouse gas emissions of Switzerland equaled 51.4 million tCO<sub>2</sub>eq and per capita emissions were at world&rsquo;s average (6.4 tCO<SUB>2</SUB>eq). The biggest share of greenhouse gas emissions arises from the transport and building sectors, followed by the industry, agriculture and waste sectors (see figure 1).</p> <p>[Please refer to the submission for Figure 1. Switzerland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by sectors in 2012.]</p> <p>Over the last 25 years, Switzerland has experienced substantial economic and population growth. These two parameters influence the consumption and production of energy, traffic volumes and the number and volumes of heated buildings, which strongly impact greenhouse gas emissions in almost all sectors. Compared to 1990, in 2012, Switzerland&rsquo;s real gross domestic product (GDP) as a measure of economic output had risen by 36 percent, the building space that had to be heated increased by 31 percent, over 36 percent more passenger cars were in circulation on Swiss roads and 19 percent more people lived in Switzerland. Greenhouse gas emissions in this period nevertheless decreased slightly: new buildings are better insulated than in the past, cars have become more fuel efficient, heating oil is increasingly replaced by natural gas and electricity (e.g. for heat pumps) and the trend away from petrol- to diesel-powered passenger cars also contributed to a reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions. Figures 2 and 3 show the respective reduction over the period 1990 to 2012 in per capita emissions by approximately 20%, in emissions per GDP by close to 30% as well as the decoupling of economic growth from the rise in greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>[Please refer to the submission for Figure 2. Per capita greenhouse gas emissions 1990 &ndash; 2012]</p> <p>[Please refer to the submission for &nbsp;Figure 3. Per GDP greenhouse gas emissions 1990 &ndash; 2012]</p> <p>Switzerland has long standing climate policies and since 2000 a specific CO<SUB>2</SUB> Act has been established. Switzerland has committed itself under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012) and reached its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent compared to 1990, including through the use of carbon credits. At the beginning of 2013, the CO<SUB>2</SUB> Act and the CO<SUB>2</SUB> Ordinance entered into force in revised form. They form the framework of the current Swiss climate policy for the period from 2013 to 2020. The desired reduction of emissions by 2020 of 20 % below 1990 levels requires decisive action. Ratification of Switzerland&rsquo;s commitment from 2013 till 2020 under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is currently under consideration by the Parliament. For the period from 2021 to 2030, the existing legal frameworks will have to be revised. These revisions are envisaged in the next few years and subject to approval by Parliament. Climate change has already left many marks in Switzerland. Both, the economy and society are affected. Since the beginning of temperature measurements in Switzerland in 1864, the average annual temperature has risen by 1.75 &deg;C. In the Alps, the glaciers have been retreating at an accelerating pace since 1980. Since 1999 alone, glaciers have lost over 12 percent of their volume. If the warming continues, only a fraction of the current glacier cover will be left by the end of the 21st century with large impacts on the seasonal availability of water for drinking water, agriculture and power generation. Parallel to the retreat of glaciers, the permanently frozen subsoil in the high mountains also continues to thaw. More frequent mountain and rock falls as well as debris slides that can endanger transport links and infrastructure in the high mountains are a result of this. Already today, large investments are necessary to secure infrastructures at higher elevations. People are also directly affected. Only recently has it also been recognized that even the slow but steady increase in daily temperatures has a demonstrable impact on the well-being of people. Daily maximum temperatures in Switzerland have risen steadily since 1960. Hotter than usual summers have already led to higher mortalities.</p> <p>Switzerland remains committed to and striving for an ambitious international agreement on climate change in line with recommendations by science to hold average global temperature increase below two degrees Celsius.\"</p>"

In this regard the relatively high installed capacity of hydro of around 120MW presents itself as a large scale storage facility for intermittent renewable inputs to be fed to the main grid. Wind has been trialled at the Butoni site in Sigatoka with mixed results. Large-scale biomass production is also an important option that is part of the mix from the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) and timber producers. In addition small scale biomass is a distinct possibility. Geothermal has been identified as early as the 1960s but due to the relatively small nominal capacity of individual sites this technology has not progressed to large scale implementation maybe incompatible with the timescale presented by climate change. In addition, other sources such as wave and ocean energy and geothermal energy have also been investigated over the past decades but are not close to implementation.</p> <p>It is clear that large-scale hydro in Fiji has been very successful and that the technology has been transferred relatively easily and implemented with considerable competence by the Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA). In recent years, the Monasavu system has been added to with another relatively large system at Nadarivatu. Unfortunately solar PV does not have as good capacity factor as hydro and so for a comparable kwh output around 5 times the installed capacity needs to be put in place. Nevertheless, solar PV is now becoming cheaper, almost by the month, and large-scale systems are now economically viable in most locations in the world with good solar regimes. In addition, such systems work best in conjunction with a fast switching stored generation option such as hydro schemes.</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Energy efficiency </span></p> <p>Energy efficiency has also been identified as a relatively low cost easily implemented option however, one that has not been seriously implemented in the country for various reasons including financial constraints. Energy efficiency will become more important as higher cost renewable resources are employed but, the law of physics always limits improvements, if they are unlikely to give the reductions needed for complete decarbonisation.</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Transport </span></p> <p>The addiction of modern society to individual transport options is common to Fiji and the country has been increasing its number of motor vehicles at around 5% pa from at least the 1970s. In addition, the engine size distribution is moving in the wrong direction for energy and emissions savings. Finally it is likely that the infrastructure that has been needed to accommodate such an increase in vehicle numbers has been a drain on national resources that is now locking in development to this transport mode. This path makes mitigation in this area difficult and more or less constrained to fuel switching (either biofuels or electricity) rather than mode changing for instance to improved public transport systems.\"</p><p>See Fiji's full INDC submission for table on \"Key challenges and Proposed Way Forward, Action and Time bound Indicators to achieve Fiji’s Emission Reduction Target.\"</p><p>See Fiji's full INDC submission for additional information on its national context, etc.</p>"

It is expected to reduce the sector emissions through modernization and facilitate those to follow recognised standards. Fuel switching, industrial energy efficiency and tax structures to promote sustainable technologies are intended actions to achieve the target.</li> <li>Waste Sector: Total waste generated in Sri Lanka is between 6500-7000 Mt per annum while only 39% is collected. Approximately 60% of total generated waste is biodegradable. It is expected to promote source separation, recycling, composting and waste-to-energy actions while the collection rate is to be increased to 50-65% by 2030.</li> <li>Forestry Sector: Current forest cover in Sri Lanka is 29.6% and is planned to be increased to 32%.

RMI looks to regional and global cooperation for support in pursuit of these mitigation and adaptation-related development priorities.</p> <p>While RMI considers its INDC as a full national commitment to be undertaken without pre-conditions, the country is at present heavily reliant on external assistance for capacity and financial resources in key national sectors. As a small economy, minor perturbations can lead to substantial changes in energy needs and related emissions trajectories. If national circumstances change, RMI will to the best of its ability stay on course to achieve its emissions targets. While longer-term national projections are uncertain, and private sector growth is imperative, it is evident that external assistance will continue to be important in achieving many national development objectives.</p> <p>The rapid development of energy&ndash;intensive economic activities intensified RMI&rsquo;s dependence on imported petroleum products, particularly in the period 2000 to 2010. The high cost of these products remains a fundamental obstacle to improving standards of living and business profitability in the country. The RMI Government is currently supported by donors and development partners to mitigate impacts of high oil prices at policy level, focused on increasing energy efficiency, minimizing the costs of imported fuels, and investing in renewable energy sources such as solar, biofuel and ocean energy.</p> <p>Specifically, international support is critical to enable RMI to implement the actions enshrined in its National Energy Policy, Climate Change Policy, Joint National Action Plan, National Strategic Plan and other sectoral policies and plans. It is also important to note that RMI has made substantial progress in implementing its 2009 National Energy Plan (up to 2020), but important gaps remain, particularly in the area of private investment. RMI will need international support for is efforts to transition towards a low-emissions energy sector through greater use of renewables such as solar, biofuels and wind, and potential use of transformational technology, such as OTEC.</p> <p>Finally, RMI will need substantial assistance to meet its adaptation objectives outlined in the prior section. As a highly vulnerable and low-lying island nation with no major points of elevation above 2 metres, RMI already experiences frequent and serious climate impacts, as well as natural hazard events.

          "value": "<p>Means of Implementation</p> <p>\"As an LDC, Myanmar requires further capacity-building along with access to technological and financial support from the international community to implement the INDC. In order to realise the intended mitigation contribution set out above and meet the nation&rsquo;s needs with respect to adaptation, Myanmar requires a significant amount of international support. The success of the mitigation and adaptation activities in Myanmar is wholly dependent on receiving sufficient technology-transfer, capacity-building and financial support from developed and more experienced countries, international agencies, donors, and the wider international community.</p> <p>As defined in Myanmar&rsquo;s Initial National Communication, the NAPA and other documents related to climate change in Myanmar, support is required as follows:</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Technology Development and Transfer.</span> A preliminary Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) was completed by MOECAF as part of the preparation of the Initial National Communication. There is a clear need for the transfer of Environmentally Sound Technologies (ESTs) such as renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies for mitigation and flood control technology and early warning technologies for adaptation. Myanmar&rsquo;s technology development and transfer needs also include technologies and skills transfer which support the implementation and operation of ESTs such as those that ensure the operation, repair and maintenance of ESTs. The understanding of technology development and transfer needs in Myanmar is still developing and an additional TNA should be completed with international support to better understand these requirements. Particularly in the energy sector, Myanmar needs to develop its knowledge, understanding and gain further access to technology that can support goals. Other examples would be the increased use of meteorological modelling technologies as these can help with the planning of renewable which are dependent on seasonal conditions, and also reduce the impact of extreme weather events by improving weather forecasting.</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Capacity-building.</span> Mitigating climate change and adapting to its impacts will require significant capacity building in all aspects of Myanmar&rsquo;s plans to implement actions identified in the INDC. Further, capacity building will help in the capturing of lessons learned so future policies and actions can be designed and implemented with maximum effect and efficiency. Human resources, scientific research, technical and institutional capacities all require development and international assistance is an important requirement in order that this can be achieved. The Initial National Communication highlighted that further work is required to develop an understanding of the specific capacity-building needs in the above mentioned areas. In addition, and of great importance, is the fact that Myanmar&rsquo;s current capacity with respect to MRV is at a very primary stage. As a consequence, there is limited reliable data to support the attraction of finance and calculate emission reductions. There are various stages of the MRV capacity building process but Myanmar will require international support at each step. Whilst the end goal may be a national greenhouse gas inventory system, this will most likely take years to develop. The first steps are likely to be readiness assessments, personnel and institutional capacity building and also sector level MRV system design.</p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Financial Support.</span> Myanmar needs sufficient and sustained financial assistance across its climate change agenda. Myanmar strongly favours support from the international community in the form of targeted and systematically implemented new funds for LDCs such as the GCF. Increased co-ordination of financial support for mitigation and adaptation measures, outreach programmes and activities, and long-term research projects will make Myanmar&rsquo;s goals more likely to be realised, therefore Myanmar wishes to work closely with such funds to ensure financial support is used effectively. Myanmar also intends to build its capacity to effectively and efficiently participate in future market based mechanisms. Financial support will first need to be determined by completing a detailed costing estimate in the very short term. It is envisaged that financial support will be utilised by Myanmar in a variety of ways including but not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>Financial support required for the Technology needs assessment for mitigation and adaptation activities, financial need assessment for estimation of implementation and operational and maintenance cost, identification of need assessment for capacity building for implementation and monitoring of mitigation and adaptation activities,</li> <li>Implementing identified actions in the forestry sector (e.g., forest assessments, reducing and stopping deforestation, rehabilitation of degraded forest lands, reforestation, forestry sector specific MRV and implementation of REDD+ projects,Implementing identified actions in the energy sector. For example clean technology development, implementation of technologies, making the use of ESTs financially viable for end users and the private sector,</li> <li>Addressing financial needs of the other key sectors which are emerging such as sustainable transportation, urbanisation, waste management and agricultural practices</li> <li>Development and implementation of other sectoral and eventually national MRV systems for monitoring of actions, producing GHG emissions inventories, quantifying development cobenefits, accounting for funds received,</li> <li>Reduction in vulnerability for example by setting up more effective early warning systems and increasing preparedness for disaster risk reduction,</li> <li>Recovering from damage already caused by climate change, e.g. rehabilitation of degraded forests and restoration of local ecosystems for people affected due to extreme weather events.\"</li> </ul> <p>See Myanmar's full INDC submission for additional information on its national circumstances, etc.</p>"

The following sections explain the strategies and measures which will be undertaken to deliver the contribution.</p> <p>The energy sector accounted for approximately 68% of St. Vincent and the Grenadines&rsquo; GHG emissions in 2010<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[2]</a> with projected further growth through to 2025, and is therefore the focus of its mitigation activity. Within the sector, approximately 50% of emissions can be attributed to energy generation and approximately 50% from transport. The following sub- sector mitigation contributions have been identified:</p> <p>i. Renewable energy: the plans for renewable energy generation are focused on the development of the country&rsquo;s proposed geothermal power plant (planned to be completed in 2018). The facility, when complete, will generate approximately 50% of the national annual electricity consumption needs. In addition to the geothermal plant, the national energy utility is renovating existing hydro power facilities to improve efficiency and generation capacity as well as enabling and encouraging the installation of small-scale photovoltaics (PV) in the private and public sectors.</p> <p>ii. Energy efficiency: there is an objective to achieve a 15% reduction in national electricity consumption<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[3]</a> compared to a BAU scenario by 2025. Planned measures in this sector include the retrofitting of street lighting nationally, a new building code and an energy labelling scheme for appliances.</p> <p>iii. Transport: new policies to reduce the import duty paid on low emission vehicles are in the process of being introduced to encourage their use. It is estimated that this will result in avoided emissions of approximately 10% over the next 10 years<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[4]</a>.</p> <p>Significant potential for greater reductions (e.g. improved public transport) is achievable if international finance can be made available, however this needs further analysis to quantify the reduction potential and support required and consequently these measures have not been included in the economy-wide contribution at this stage. Currently, transport is the fastest growing source of emissions and reductions from this sector will be largely dependent on international financial support and technology transfer.</p> <p>iv. Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF): St. Vincent and the Grenadines intends to develop its GHG sinks though reforestation, afforestation reduced deforestation and reduced forest degradation. At this stage, good quality data does not exist for the forestry inventory, however this is in the process of being addressed. Once the forestry inventory is compiled, policies and actions will be developed for the sector, however the related contribution is not quantifiable at this stage. Policies and actions may be delivered through mechanisms such as the &lsquo;Clean Development Mechanism&rsquo; (CDM) and &lsquo;Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation&rsquo; (REDD).\"</p> <p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Excluding international aviation and shipping<br /><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\">[2]</a> St. Vincent and the Grenadines 2010 Mitigation Assessment (to be published shortly as part of the Second National Communication).
