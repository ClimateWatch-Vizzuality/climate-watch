# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the available tests (with Jest).<br>

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn rails:cleanimport`

Drops, creates, migrates and imports the Database to get a full clean import (very slow process)

### `yarn deploy:staging`

Deploy to staging

### `yarn deploy:production`

Deploy to production
