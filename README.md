# Climate Watch

Add some nice description of the project.

## Local setup

### Installing dependencies

```
yarn run js:install
```

and then

```
yarn run rails:install
```

These will satisfy both the frontend and backend's dependency requirements.

#### Setting up the Rails environment

Copy the sample `.env.sample` file to `.env` and modify it as needed to fit the
project's settings. At the very least you'll need to have the `DATABASE_URL`
env variable.

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres@localhost/climate-watch_development
```

#### Setting up the database

```
yarn run rails:db:create
```

and then

```
yarn run rails:db:migrate
```

These will create the development database and then run the database migration tasks.

### Launching The App

You'll need to run both the rails server and the webpack server, which will be used internally by rails. Run, separately:

```
yarn run rails:server
```

and

```
yarn run js:server
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`. Ta-da!
