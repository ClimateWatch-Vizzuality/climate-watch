In particular: Transport: continued use of internal combustion engines with very low take up of electric and hydrogen vehicles. Buildings: continued use of gas for cooking and relatively low take up of insulation and low carbon heating technologies in homes because the consumer does not want the upheaval. Electricity: less use of wind than some of the other 2 degree C pathways because consumers do not want to see changes to their landscape. Wastes and residues: relatively low collection of waste by households. Instead, the low-carbon activity happens in a way the consumer is less directly aware of: Higher use of nuclear and CCS. Higher effort on land use (higher food yields, etc.) and relatively high afforestation. This is a low electrification pathway, with high use of bioenergy. This pathway shows that it is possible to have low consumer acceptance of technologies that have a direct impact on them.

I still think governments should push much stronger and tax these significantly in the long run. Technology and fuels: The demand side is pushed a little more than the supply side (up to level 3), as reducing energy demand has other side effects than CO2 and leads to a more resilient system. No CCS is used as it seems it can be avoided (I am impressed by this finding, but I am not sure it holds after 2050, as I see negative emissions, can you confirm?), there is a lot of uncertainty around it and this leads additional material requirements. Nuclear is kept at today's levels (level 1,5) as it is unrealistic to think it will not be used by some countries. But more emphasis is set on RES at level 2,3. Fossil fuel efficiency at 3 at is of paramount importance to use the fossil fuels we have most efficiently, and we push for more gas use in power production. Land and food: We do not push land and food levers too far as this could lead to other serious issues (e.g., extensive use of fertilizer, large need of water). Much of the surplus land is simply used to regenerate forests and grasslands. Demographics: we keep the standard level 2 assumptions which we understand are the UN base case assumptions.

The impacts or damages that are likely to result from a 4 degree C temperature rise are not included within the model or the optimisation process.","geographic_coverage_country":[],"sectoral_coverage":[],"gas_and_pollutant_coverage":[],"policy_coverage":[],"policy_coverage_detailed":null,"technology_coverage":[],"technology_coverage_detailed":null,"energy_resource_coverage":[],"time_horizon":"2100","time_step":"10","climate_target_type":null,"large_scale_bioccs":null,"technology_assumptions":null,"gdp_assumptions":null,"population_assumptions":null,"discount_rates":null,"emission_factors":null,"global_warming_potentials":null,"policy_cut_off_year_for_baseline":null,"literature_reference":null,"purpose_or_objective":"The \"TICM-UCL 4DS\" scenario is an approximate representation of the least cost global energy system generated by the integrated assessment model TIAM-UCL, producing an emissions trajectory that results in around a 60% chance of limiting average global temperature increase to 2 degree C","key_usage":null,"project":null,"climate_target_detailed":null,"climate_target_date":null,"overshoot":null,"other_target_type":null,"other_target":null,"burden_sharing":null},{"id":62,"model_id":16,"name":"WEC PSI-Symphony","model_abbreviation":"GC","category":"not specified","description":"Developed by the World Energy Council (WEC): One of WEC's two World Energy Scenarios to 2050, Symphony has a focus on achieving environmental sustainability through internationally coordinated policies and practices. In the Symphony scenario, there is a voter consensus on driving environmental sustainability and energy security through corresponding practices and policies. The main players are governments, the public sector, private companies, NGOs, and environmentally minded voters. Selected energy sources are subsidised and incentivised by governments and certain types of renewable and low carbon energy are actively promoted by governments. Carbon market is top-down, based on an international agreement with commitments and allocations. Some nationalistic strategies result in reduced imports/exports.  As there is less cross-border convergence, more environmental constraints and a more capital-intensive growth pathway, GDP growth in the Symphony scenario is slightly lower. Built through consultaton with experts worldwide using a global multi-regional MARKAL (GMM) model, WEC's World Energy Scenarios to 2050 are designed to glimpse what the future might look like in a plausible and maybe challenging manner - yet they are not meant to be exact or precise forecasts. These scenarios are designed to help a range of stakeholders address the \"energy trilemma\" of achieving environmental sustainability, energy security, and energy equity and hence putting forward different policy options.

If their decarbonization rate is below a specified minimum (2% per year), they instead follow a muddling through path defined by that 2% minimum rate. It is important to clarify the logic behind the setting up of minimum decarbonization rates in the Paris scenarios in the first place. Countries with high decarbonization rates required to meet their INDC commitments will need to follow up their INDC commitments with very aggressive action post-2030 in order to maintain their decarbonization rates. For the U.S., the E.U. and other countries whose INDCs are in the form of an absolute emissions level (equivalently a reduction from a specified historic emissions level), a high constant decarbonization rate requires rapidly falling emissions targets after 2030. The \"low hanging fruit\" for post-2030 emissions reductions is thus from the countries with very low required decarbonizatio rates embodied in their INDCs. For many of the developing countries, decarbonization rates below 2% can still imply growing emissions levels. These countries are more likely to be able to increase their decarboniztion rates post- 2030, even with modest improvements in emissions targets.","geographic_coverage_country":["Africa_Eastern","Africa_Northern","Africa_Southern","Africa_Western","Argentina","Australia_NZ","Brazil","Canada","China","Colombia","EU-12","EU-15","Europe_Eastern","Europe_Non_EU","India","Indonesia","Japan","Mexico","Middle East","Pakistan","Russia","South Africa","South America_Southern","South America_Northern","South Asia","South Korea","Southeast Asia","Taiwan","USA"],"sectoral_coverage":[],"gas_and_pollutant_coverage":[],"policy_coverage":[],"policy_coverage_detailed":null,"technology_coverage":[],"technology_coverage_detailed":null,"energy_resource_coverage":[],"time_horizon":"2100","time_step":"5","climate_target_type":null,"large_scale_bioccs":null,"technology_assumptions":null,"gdp_assumptions":null,"population_assumptions":null,"discount_rates":null,"emission_factors":null,"global_warming_potentials":null,"policy_cut_off_year_for_baseline":null,"literature_reference":null,"purpose_or_objective":"The \"Paris - Continued ambition\" scenario Illustrates the potential implications of INDCs.

services, optimized according to a number of user constraints (e.g. CO2 emissions cap), over medium to long-term time horizons. TIMES_PT characterizes the entire chain of the Portuguese energy system from 2005 to 2050 (in 5-year steps), including energy imports and production (e.g., oil and bio refineries), transformation (e.g., power and heat production), distribution, exports and end-use consumption, in industry, residential, services, agriculture and transport sectors and their respective sub-sectors.  TIMES_PT has been developed since 2004 and has benefited from the peer-review of numerous national partners from industrial sectors, power production, oil refining and end-use energy sectors. TIMES_PT model informed climate policy in Portugal in the last 10 years and has supported the design of climate mitigation policies.  The development of the TIMES_PT model started within the EU research project NEEDS and the national research project E2POL. Although its implementation was motivated by research goals, during the past decade the model has become a major tool supporting national climate mitigation policies, and to a lesser extent, air pollution policies. The Low Carbon Roadmap 2050 is a flagship policy document currently used as the Portuguese long term view on mitigation goals, while the PNAC— National Plan on Climate Change includes the visions up to 2030 from stakeholders from other policy areas, as transportation and industry. The negotiations for the revisions of the National Emission Ceilings Directive for 2020 and 2030, as well as the National Strategy for Air Quality (2015) were supported by projections generated by TIMES_PT. More recently, TIMES_PT was linked with a national CGE model, which has motivated its use in the Green Tax Reform.","key_usage":"Energy scenarios, GHG mitigation, energy-climate policy","abbreviation":"TIMES-PT","current_version":"v2017","development_year":2004,"programming_language":"GAMS","maintainer_name":"Energy \u0026 Climate Group of CENSE/NOVA University of Lisbon ","license":"Updated","availability":"No but results are free to use","expertise":"advanced","expertise_detailed":"","platform_detailed":"VEDA software (VEDA_FE \u0026 VEDA_BE)","purpose_or_objective":"Development of low carbon energy scenarios for Portugal","time_step":"5","time_horizon":"2050","sectoral_coverage":["agriculture, buildings (residential and commercial), transportation, electricity, industry, services"],"scenarios":[{"id":67,"model_id":11,"name":"REF","model_abbreviation":"TIMES-PT","category":"BAU/reference","description":"This scenario assumes de following energy-climate policies for 2020 extended up to 2050:Renewable energy: 31% of total final energy consumption/The following GHG emission ceiling for the Portuguese economy is in place following the Effort-sharing DecisionÕs objectives (+1% in 2020 vis-ˆ-vis 2005 verified emissions) and of EU-ETS (total of free allowances issued until 2020).
