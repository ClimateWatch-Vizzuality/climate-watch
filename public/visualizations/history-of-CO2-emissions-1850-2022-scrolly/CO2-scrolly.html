    <p>From 1850 to the mid-20th century, the world experienced near-constant growth in emissions. This was due largely to industrialization and population growth in the United States and Europe. The <b style="color:#0097a5;">U.S.</b> became the top CO2 emitter in 1887 and saw the greatest acceleration in emissions over the next nine decades, followed by the <b style="color:#3956a4;">United Kingdom</b> and <b style="color: #3956a4;">Germany</b>.<a href="#story/2350784/slide-1"></a></p>

    <p>This trend was occasionally interrupted by historic events, like the Great Depression in the 1930s and the end of World War II in 1945. But the resulting emissions reductions were only temporary. Countries in North America and Europe continued to dominate global emissions through the first half of the century. As a result, the <b style="color:#0097a5;">U.S.</b> and <b style="color: #3956a4;">EU</b> remain the largest cumulative emitters to date, bearing responsibility for most CO2 in the atmosphere.<a href="#story/2350784/slide-2"></a></p>

    <p>From the 1950s to 1980s, <b style="color:#3956a4;">Russia</b> also experienced rapid emissions growth. However, its emissions dropped off significantly with the dissolution of the Soviet Union.<br /><br /> For comparison, the <b style="color:#3956a4;">U.K.</b>, once the world’s highest emitter, stabilized its total CO2 emissions around 1970.<a href="#story/2350784/slide-3"></a></p>

    <p>While the <b style="color:#0097a5;">United States</b> kept its place as the top CO2 emitter throughout the 20th century, Asian countries began to emerge onto the scene, led by <b style="color:#ee3261;">China</b>.<a href="#story/2350784/slide-4"></a></p>

    <p>Since then, China’s economy has continued to expand rapidly — along with its consumption of fossil fuels. <b style="color:#ee3261;">China</b> surpassed the <b style="color:#0097a5;">U.S.</b> as the world's top CO2 emitter in 2005.<a href="#story/2350784/slide-5"></a></p>

    <p>A similar picture emerges when looking at emissions by region. <b style="color:#ee3261;">East Asia and the Pacific</b> became the top regional emitter in 2004. By 2022, it was contributing 44% of global CO2 emissions. <b style="color:#3956a4;">Europe and Central Asia</b> and <b style="color:#0097a5;">North America</b>, the next-highest emitting regions, accounted for 17% and 15% respectively.  However, this only represents total annual emissions.<a href="#story/2350784/slide-6"></a></p>

    <p>When it comes to per capita emissions, <b style="color:#0097a5;">North America</b>, remains the highest by far, followed by <b style="color:#3956a4;">Europe and Central Asia</b>. However, <b style="color:#ee3261;">East Asia and the Pacific</b> is very close to becoming the second largest per-person emitter.<a href="#story/2350784/slide-7"></a></p>

    <p>Looking at cumulative emissions since 1850, <b style="color:#3956a4;">Europe and Central Asia</b> still have the highest total, followed by <b style="color:#0097a5;">North America</b>. But <b style="color:#ee3261;">East Asia and the Pacific</b> is rapidly catching up here, too. <a href="#story/2350784/slide-8"></a></p>
