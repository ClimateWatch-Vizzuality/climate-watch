# Data format guidelines

Over the course of the Climate Watch project, you may need/wish to update the sites data. Please provide your data updates according the following formatting guidelines.

**Please provide all files in comma separated value (*.csv*) format with utf-8 encoding.** This will avoid any issues with special characters. If you have your data in an Excel table and are unsure how to produce a *csv* file, you can export a single sheet (the active sheet) by clicking `Save As` in the drop-down `File` menu, and selecting *csv* as a file-type.

Unless you have a specific reason not to do so, any empty columns should be filled with the character `NA` rather than being left blank.

## NDC-SDG Linkages
